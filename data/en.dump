we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and we did an operation , and my company did a dawn attack - - you know , the classic dawn attack : you prepare all night , move to the line of departure . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
and yet , we need to have that shared sense . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
this removes the distinction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state . 
we think we have solved the mystery of creation . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet . 
this brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race . 
it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million . 
but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years , our future is in space . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .

and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
you know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
and this is what it is . 
what i said about there being no non - aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification . 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
go ! 
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera . 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
the majority of people . 
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism . 
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest . 
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire . 
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me . 
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love - - mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other - - are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire . 
our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore . 
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree - - which produced this painting - - moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines . 
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns . 
and kids are working in countless group assignments . 
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well - managed environment and take it from there . 
so they did it with mouse pups , kittens . 
they did it with pigs . 
they did it with puppies . 
and if you can do it with monkeys - - though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes - - if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings . 
be easier to find us at night . 
and eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves - - which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms . 
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being . 
but first , my disclosures . 
but that very fact is telling . 
where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire . 
but it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre - menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent . 
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system . 
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day . 
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard . 
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink . 
but we can ask the obvious question : is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ? 
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do . 
so , some combustible material there . 
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face - - i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under . 
dreadful . thumbs down . 
any of you get really freaked out by that ? 
you might want to leave now . 
but part of the reason that i found this interesting is that i started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion , and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living - - that are surviving . 
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions . 
so here is the bottom line . 
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair - - so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors - - so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system . 
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance . 
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations - - the hummingbird hawk - moth is beautiful in its adaptation . 
these are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it , the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with . 
this thing does something else which is unusual . 
so the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future . 
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ? 
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations . 
you need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible . 
so my argument today is basically this . 
there was a reason for everything . 
it seems so obvious , and yet it is not . 
and i began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . and i saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility . 
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format . 
the underground railroad was a brilliant hack . 
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the house . 
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind - - the images that these thoughts created - - and the action that derived from it . 
difficult . 
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , i brought laser - sharp focus into my dance , laser - sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery . 
as i ride out , as i ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , i want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror . 
we will observe this day . 
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least . 
now , as a pediatric endocrinologist , i used to be very , very involved , and still somewhat am , in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals , and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex . 
that sometimes shows up in the first decade of life , but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross - gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins . 
but at the time that puberty begins , that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls , 12 to 14 in boys , with breast budding or two to three times increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males , by that particular point , the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings , no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things . 
does this make so - and - so straight ? 
the fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get . 
and they fall apart . 
so this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out , they can have more and more testing , they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them . 
in a crowd . 
they were out there suffering , is where they were . 
they had to homeschool her . 
and so here she is at 16 , on the left . 
they cost a fortune . 
this is not that common . 
they have this very continuous feedback loop . 
oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it .

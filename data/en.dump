but still , we look at the pieces . 
and this is the tower from below . 
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering . 
we have to get special flight clearance . 
well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that . 
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind . 
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms - - black and white , subtitled , documentary , non - narrative , fantasy - - and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth . 
they are neither feral nor myopically self - absorbed . 
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
so he got the right weight at birth . 
and what went wrong ? 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
porous , nonporous . 
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work . 
do you rip it off quickly - - short duration but high intensity - - or do you take your band - aid off slowly - - you take a long time , but each second is not as painful - - which one of those is the right approach ? 
the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip . 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks - - all kinds of versions of pain . 
and when i finished hurting people a little bit , i would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ? 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
people did this . i would pay people four dollars for their task - - on average people would solve four problems . 
i would pass their sheet of paper . 
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces . 
no bill ever disappeared . 
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ? 
but think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody i liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time . 
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions . 
this is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute . 
any science geeks , you get that one . 
reach behind you . there you go . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
the clientele behavior was very much the same too . 
do i have a place , a venue , in mind when i write ? 
it actually improves it . 
and well , that was an opera experience . 
okay . 
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music . 
the tempos are medium . it sounds big . 
presumably , this is just for christian music . 
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something . 
thank you very much . 
my pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be . 
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . 
and for a few days you got those images . 
and that was the end of it . 
and it goes the other way around . 
now , melting point has a lot to do with this . 
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge . 
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again . 
fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . same thing . 
to start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place . 
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
we just read the back of a label on a packet . 
the ordering principle of his vision . 
cows with a view . 
steaming piles of humus . 
so that became a challenge . 
compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that i was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions . 
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase . 
trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want . 
the lightest touch of her arm - - the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on - - caused excruciating , burning pain . 
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house . 
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life . 
but the third challenge we have - - and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge - - is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy - - every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash . 
and in each of those , it was only part of the country . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
and yet , the impossible is happening . 
it keeps getting reinfected . 
now what about the money ? 
and that great buy costs us a little bit more . 
but soon the idea began spreading virally . 
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending . 
thank you for making your site . 
they can be shocking or silly or soulful . 
growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating - - no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger - - and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects . 
hold your head up . look at me . 
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family . 
and the limousine empties out . 
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box . 
he was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old - - younger guys . 
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys . 
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good . 
he was a troubled kid . 
his grandmother had two jobs . 
he was home alone a lot . 
he was cool . he was fine . 
we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and then you hook up , and you hook up your static line . 
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door . 
in 30 - some years of jumping , i never did one . 
and i realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money i got out of it . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls . 
do your job simply , the girl will chase you . 
this meant they must have been closer together in the past . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
thank you very much indeed . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely . 
he built a playhouse for our daughter . 
so we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
he started it just two weeks ago . 
it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious . 
so what do we make of all of this ? 
and they were readily available . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
on the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom . 
so we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground . 
and the latter won out . 
instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn . . . 
this graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning . 
how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ? 
and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints . 
90 percent of your long - term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world . 
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat . 
the absence of disease is not health . 
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior . 
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise . 
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed . 
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed . 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of . 
and at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first . 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters . 
and finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness . 
and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier . 
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty - six people died . nearly 300 , 000 homes were lost . 
the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff . 
so some solutions to heat can provide for win - win - wins . 
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities . 
hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ? 
now the thing is , i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging . 
and this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me . 
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging . 
you know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100 , 000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ? 
right . so the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ? 
and the fundamental answer is that the pro - aging trance is not as dumb as it looks . 
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self - repair mechanisms , because those self - repair mechanisms are not perfect . 
and there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging . 
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon . 
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today - - or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive - - would actually live ? 
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it . 
we can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like . 
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore . 
that in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle - aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp . 
well , it seems to get the point across . 
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive . 
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit . 
and this is what it is . 
and there are only seven of them . 
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top . 
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ? 
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole . 
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude . 
i could barely breathe . 
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on . 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
i got myself to the side of the lake . 
and my team just gave it to me straight . 
and remember , never ever swim with aggression . 
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift . 
and i ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it . 
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls . 
every now and then , i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally . 
and yet i forget about it all the time . 
it is easy to forget the gasp - inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life . 
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug . 
i took it out for the first time to come here . 
go ! 
should it be by just walking around looking down ? 
this project has lasted now , been just over two years . 
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera . 
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole - hearted living , i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown . 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
and that myth is profoundly dangerous . 
the majority of people . 
the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat . 
shame is one , do not be perceived as what ? 
i was in the third year of my seven - year undergraduate degree . 
i took a couple victory laps in there . 
now fast forward to just three years ago . 
could we have people singing together in real time ? 
and praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that . 
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see . 
what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ? 
on the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence - - all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home . 
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms . 
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism . 
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest . 
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire . 
basically , when i look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn - on across the board . 
radiant , as in self - sustaining . 
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan , lies that movement toward the other . 
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me . 
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ? 
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love - - mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other - - are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire . 
you know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct . 
our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore . 
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end . 
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time . 
are you going to curse me ? are you going to scold me ? 
foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm . 
trees epitomize stasis . 
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree - - which produced this painting - - moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines . 
would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ? 
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce . 
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are - - all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding . 
for one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them . 
but enough of the theory . 
the rocket was huge . 
now we have the good fortune to open up space . 
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns . 
i could have told you 50 others just like it - - all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert . 
shyness is about fear of social judgment . 
and kids are working in countless group assignments . 
even in subjects like math and creative writing , which you think would depend on solo flights of thought , kids are now expected to act as committee members . 
and when it comes to leadership , introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though introverts tend to be very careful , much less likely to take outsize risks - - which is something we might all favor nowadays . 
this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity , because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas , but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them . 
so no wilderness , no revelations . 
so . . . 
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well - managed environment and take it from there . 
underneath this ceremonial role , he was really modest and really introverted - - so much so that when he delivered these sermons , he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years . 
number one : stop the madness for constant group work . 
okay , number two : go to the wilderness . 
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in . 
of course , clubs and discos , too . 
so , as you all know , species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments , and the pressures of those environments selected which changes , through random mutation in species , were going to be preserved . 
and that has been the second great - - couple 100 , 000 years , 150 , 000 years - - flow of our evolution . 
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them . 
and they are now making them , and someday , perhaps pretty soon , you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket . 
but something much , much more powerful is happening now . 
and what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light . 
so they did it with mouse pups , kittens . 
they did it with pigs . 
they did it with puppies . 
and , in fact , they did it with monkeys . 
and if you can do it with monkeys - - though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes - - if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings . 
be easier to find us at night . 
in other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed . 
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create . 
that dna is passed down through our mothers . 
it gets worse than that - - or perhaps better than that . 
the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthetic arm would do . 
and eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves - - which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms . 
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator . 
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being . 
this is where we are in this process . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
but first , my disclosures . 
but that very fact is telling . 
where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire . 
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 . 
but it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre - menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent . 
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system . 
our big break came in 2004 . 
after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology . 
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day . 
so , i started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk . 
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it . 
interestingly , what i did with these rollers is , basically , i took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line . 
so , these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly . 
we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things ; what about that ? 
so , rather than waiting for that , i actually made my own , just using a piece of paper . 
so i now have a print - out of that thing , and now - - the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back , rather than now switching between these two worlds . 
this is incredible , really . 
what are you doing with this ? is there a company being planned ? 
common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt . 
and so for her , i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that & # 91 ; knee & # 93 ; joint space . 
and & # 91 ; the allograft & # 93 ; replaces & # 91 ; the missing meniscus & # 93 ; . 
and so with that , coming to a - - coming to an operating theater near you soon , i believe . 
how are we going to feed this world ? 
you get a new disease that can be deadly . 
well they are . 
they just make it & # 91 ; with & # 93 ; nuts or something . 
1 . 1 million of them . 
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival . 
this is , obviously , that famous view now of the arctic , which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years . very , very , very scary . 
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard . 
we started right there , with absolutely nothing . 
the exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people . 
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited . 
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world . 
and these job losses , we can fix them with green - collar jobs . 
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church . 
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable . 
not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out . 
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink . 
now that can be daunting . 
now my point is the small things matter . 
they are facts about the well - being of conscious creatures . 
now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : this is something that we could be right or wrong about . and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects . 
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind - - neuroscience , psychology , etc . 
but we can ask the obvious question : is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ? 
now , many of you might worry that the notion of well - being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re - construed . 
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : there may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing . 
consider , by analogy , the game of chess . 
but it clearly admits some exceptions . 
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do . 
and yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity . 
how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ? 
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well - being ? 
so , some combustible material there . 
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming - with - rage thing , after as well , some of them . 
language seems to be really important here . 
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face - - i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under . 
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness . 
so , everything is not going to be up for grabs . 
if you get all those parts aligned , yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love . 
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes . 
so effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything . 
dreadful . thumbs down . 
embarrassing . okay , wonderful , great . 
and a lot of us - - and i suspect , especially a lot of us in this room - - deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students , perfectionists , over - achievers . 
they have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly . 
and for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up . 
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings . 
and something else happened instead . 
and something else happened instead . 
and in order to make it even more exciting , he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun , and he brings out the temple vessels . 
and it had to recognize their different habits , different peoples , different religions , different faiths . 
this is heady national rhetoric , and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return . 
any of you get really freaked out by that ? 
you might want to leave now . 
and he was telling me that really , we ought to try and eradicate these things . 
but part of the reason that i found this interesting is that i started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion , and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living - - that are surviving . 
and in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism . 
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways . 
so bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers . 
right . 
they were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week . 
then , collect your cracked nut in safety . 
and since that time , all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior . 
now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off . 
so , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot . 
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way . 
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions . 
so here is the bottom line . 
now here is the net out of this . 
in fact it would be basically nil . 
incidentally , they did pull it off . 
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers . 
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair - - so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors - - so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system . 
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality . 
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance . 
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations - - the hummingbird hawk - moth is beautiful in its adaptation . 
these are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it , the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with . 
so it probably even feels good for the insect , as well as looking good . 
at night they get covered in pollen , which showers down over them , and then the bristles that we saw above , they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out , covered in pollen - - fabulous thing . 
that sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long . 
this thing does something else which is unusual . 
and they get inside , and they get it all on . 
and the plant showers them with pollen , and off they go and pollinate . 
this is what it looks like if you take out the red . 
same with planning . somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution ? 
now , at the end , nonviolent discipline , and this is probably the game - changer . 
now let me move to another place . 
we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used . 
of course , you could bet they have done the most stupid thing : they arrested the barrel . and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car , that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have . 
it can put the price tag of state - sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters . 
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents - - a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified . 
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations , it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do . 
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation . 
so the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future . 
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ? 
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations . 
you need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible . 
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years . 
so my argument today is basically this . 
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors . 
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth . 
and none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her . 
there is nothing wrong with your brain . there is nothing wrong with your mind . 
i work in old - age homes , largely . 
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations . 
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations . 
a lot of them had to do with a car . 
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned . 
and , above all , she would see cartoons . 
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these . 
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully . 
well , yeah , a lot of them . 
but they stop there . 
there , the animal finds a mine . 
the value of nothing : out of nothing comes something . 
and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time i was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different . 
because all i could really do was represent in a very one - on - one way . 
and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book . 
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma . 
that figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age . 
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure . 
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it . 
there was a reason for everything . 
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ? 
how do i , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ? 
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life . 
and they all operate at the same time . 
there is also a big question of ambiguity . 
and ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and i have it . moral ambiguity . 
and they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed . 
and all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response . 
do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it ? 
and then , in a way , i knew that they had always been there . 
and what i need , in effect , is a focus . 
and you are noticing it more often . 
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions . 
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of . 
we come to this point and say , what do i as an individual do ? 
also , i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide . 
it seems so obvious , and yet it is not . 
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know . 
there are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book . 
and i needed to find something historically that would match that . 
you wonder , are these things random chance ? 
a big thing that i also think about is accidents . 
and so i was there on three occasions , different seasons . 
and i began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . and i saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility . 
i have to think of my role . where i am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something i came up with ? 
so , there are never complete answers . 
because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling . 
there she is . 
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format . 
and mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of . 
but like most things in technology and the technology world , hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil . 
hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity . 
the underground railroad was a brilliant hack . 
so keep that in mind . 
now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content . 
i authored this answer , and a few others . 
so when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting , cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government . 
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the house . 
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind - - the images that these thoughts created - - and the action that derived from it . 
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness . 
i needed something that would pull me out of all this . 
i needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that i could go from there . 
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ? 
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ? 
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have . 
so i would drag myself into my dance studio - - body , mind and spirit - - every day into my dance studio , and learn everything i learned when i was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped . 
difficult . 
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , i brought laser - sharp focus into my dance , laser - sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery . 
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist . 
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule . 
as i ride out , as i ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , i want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror . 
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do . 
in fact , i have got qualifications . 
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing . 
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually . 
yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality . 
we will observe this day . 
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least . 
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything . 
and obviously the life - saving is increased , the concepts help . 
norman spack : how i help transgender teens become who they want to be 
i want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you , or if you were delivering , about the person you were delivering . 
now , as a pediatric endocrinologist , i used to be very , very involved , and still somewhat am , in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals , and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex . 
that sometimes shows up in the first decade of life , but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross - gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins . 
but at the time that puberty begins , that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls , 12 to 14 in boys , with breast budding or two to three times increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males , by that particular point , the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings , no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things . 
now this is relatively rare , so i had relatively little personal experience with this , and my experience was more typical only because i had an adolescent practice . 
does this make so - and - so straight ? 
the fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get . 
and they fall apart . 
so this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out , they can have more and more testing , they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them . 
in a crowd . 
they were out there suffering , is where they were . 
they had to homeschool her . 
and yet , she had just begun a male puberty . 
and so here she is at 16 , on the left . 
go figure . 
she has a bit of a form to her . 
so where do we go from here ? 
well , we still have a ways to go in terms of anti - discrimination . 
they cost a fortune . 
this is not that common . 
but the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide , but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society . 
coke is everywhere . 
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing . 
they have this very continuous feedback loop . 
and my answer must at once be , it is no use . 
oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it . 
and i would add a cautionary note here , however . 
in life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and i think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage . 
it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off . 
we then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta . 
happy , away i went . 
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ? 
a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big u . k . charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal . 
it must be rubbish . they binned it . 
and in fact , there are many surgeons in the u . k . 
dead easy to give him respect . 
now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic . 
three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health - and earth - friendly diet . 
seriously . 
they both get it wrong , though . 
now , i know everybody over the age of , like 45 - - their mouths are watering at this point . 
but this may have cut down on housework , but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well . 
not that they were any good , but they were there . 
sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed - - the beginning of the heyday of value - added food , which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it . 
all you do is nuke it . what could be better ? 
and zapped horribly , pathetically . 
can farm - raised salmon be organic , when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet , even if the feed itself is supposedly organic , and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens , swimming in their own filth ? 
we can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so . 
okay , here we go . 
okay , so you smile , frowning . 
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school . 
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around . 
building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand . 
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before . 
could we bring down the lights please ? thank you . 
hey . 
he figured out the system . 
uh oh . 
hey . 
bye - bye . 
so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ 10 , 000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects , i thought they were really well - meaning , but a bit naive . 
we garnered much support along the way . 
why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood ? 
25 percent of us are unemployed . low - income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care . 
poor people are not only still poor ; they are still unhealthy . 
i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down . 
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems . 
and if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community , that is bad and ugly , how could it not reflect on you ? 
he looked at the demographics . 
you , however , are blessed with the gift of influence . 
what troubled me was that this top - down approach is still around . 
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong . 
just look how many . 
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the western population moved over to here . 
so this is where they are today . 
they are now buying cars . 
so there they are . 
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well - educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those & # 91 ; richer also & # 93 ; have . 
but there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying - - there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle . 
and if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology - - so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap - - then they will move all the way up here . 
well , here population & # 91 ; growth & # 93 ; comes in because there & # 91 ; among emerging economies & # 93 ; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end . 
so these & # 91 ; poorest & # 93 ; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion . 
because we already have this & # 91 ; growth & # 93 ; in process . 
but if , and only if , & # 91 ; the poorest & # 93 ; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come & # 91 ; to live & # 93 ; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 . 
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here - - high child - survival , small families - - and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival . 
it can be done . 
this will not happen & # 91 ; again & # 93 ; . 
it was venerable . 
it was ubiquitous . 
well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles . 
how about this week ? 
now , how about your household energy use ? 
anybody check that today ? 
a few energy geeks spread out across the room . 
so what does this tell us ? 
in fact , it already is . 
we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar - sized homes . 
they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it . 
we did everything that letter told us to do , and still i know there must be more . 
thank you . 
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self - stimulatory movements that led them nowhere . 
extremely , extremely isolated . 
now , what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further . 
there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school , you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them , to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly , relentlessly , but often in an awkward fashion , without that immediate resonance . 
well , this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time . 
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat , i can tell you , and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition . 
and we actually have a bit of a question here , because if there are so many different causes of autism , how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome ? because people like myself , when we walk into a playroom , we recognize a child as having autism . 
autism creates itself . 
we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with . 
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory , but in order for us to do that , we had to create these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , how little babies , how newborns , engage with the world , moment by moment , what is important , and what is not . 
well , we created those measures , and here , what you see is what we call a funnel of attention . 
in this scan pass , in green here , are two - year - olds with autism . 
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed , and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers . 
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation . 
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40 , 000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life . 
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications . 
this is a real thing .

but still , we look at the pieces . 
and this is the tower from below . 
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering . 
we have to get special flight clearance . 
well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that . 
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind . 
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms - - black and white , subtitled , documentary , non - narrative , fantasy - - and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth . 
they are neither feral nor myopically self - absorbed . 
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
so he got the right weight at birth . 
and what went wrong ? 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
porous , nonporous . 
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work . 
do you rip it off quickly - - short duration but high intensity - - or do you take your band - aid off slowly - - you take a long time , but each second is not as painful - - which one of those is the right approach ? 
the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip . 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks - - all kinds of versions of pain . 
and when i finished hurting people a little bit , i would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ? 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
people did this . i would pay people four dollars for their task - - on average people would solve four problems . 
i would pass their sheet of paper . 
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces . 
no bill ever disappeared . 
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ? 
but think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody i liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time . 
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions . 
this is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute . 
any science geeks , you get that one . 
reach behind you . there you go . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
the clientele behavior was very much the same too . 
do i have a place , a venue , in mind when i write ? 
it actually improves it . 
and well , that was an opera experience . 
okay . 
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music . 
the tempos are medium . it sounds big . 
presumably , this is just for christian music . 
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something . 
thank you very much . 
my pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be . 
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . 
and for a few days you got those images . 
and that was the end of it . 
and it goes the other way around . 
now , melting point has a lot to do with this . 
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge . 
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again . 
fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . same thing . 
to start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place . 
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
we just read the back of a label on a packet . 
the ordering principle of his vision . 
cows with a view . 
steaming piles of humus . 
so that became a challenge . 
compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that i was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions . 
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase . 
trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want . 
the lightest touch of her arm - - the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on - - caused excruciating , burning pain . 
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house . 
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life . 
but the third challenge we have - - and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge - - is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy - - every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash . 
and in each of those , it was only part of the country . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
and yet , the impossible is happening . 
it keeps getting reinfected . 
now what about the money ? 
and that great buy costs us a little bit more . 
but soon the idea began spreading virally . 
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending . 
thank you for making your site . 
they can be shocking or silly or soulful . 
growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating - - no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger - - and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects . 
hold your head up . look at me . 
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family . 
and the limousine empties out . 
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box . 
he was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old - - younger guys . 
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys . 
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good . 
he was a troubled kid . 
his grandmother had two jobs . 
he was home alone a lot . 
he was cool . he was fine . 
we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and then you hook up , and you hook up your static line . 
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door . 
in 30 - some years of jumping , i never did one . 
and i realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money i got out of it . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls . 
do your job simply , the girl will chase you . 
this meant they must have been closer together in the past . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
thank you very much indeed . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely . 
he built a playhouse for our daughter . 
so we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
he started it just two weeks ago . 
it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious . 
so what do we make of all of this ? 
and they were readily available . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
on the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom . 
so we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground . 
and the latter won out . 
instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn . . . 
this graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning . 
how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ? 
and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints . 
90 percent of your long - term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world . 
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat . 
the absence of disease is not health . 
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior . 
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise . 
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed . 
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed . 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of . 
and at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first . 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters . 
and finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness . 
and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier . 
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty - six people died . nearly 300 , 000 homes were lost . 
the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff . 
so some solutions to heat can provide for win - win - wins . 
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities . 
hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ? 
now the thing is , i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging . 
and this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me . 
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging . 
you know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100 , 000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ? 
right . so the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ? 
and the fundamental answer is that the pro - aging trance is not as dumb as it looks . 
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self - repair mechanisms , because those self - repair mechanisms are not perfect . 
and there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging . 
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon . 
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today - - or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive - - would actually live ? 
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it . 
we can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like . 
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore . 
that in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle - aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp . 
well , it seems to get the point across . 
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive . 
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit . 
and this is what it is . 
and there are only seven of them . 
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top . 
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ? 
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole . 
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude . 
i could barely breathe . 
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on . 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
i got myself to the side of the lake . 
and my team just gave it to me straight . 
and remember , never ever swim with aggression . 
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift . 
and i ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it . 
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls . 
every now and then , i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally . 
and yet i forget about it all the time . 
it is easy to forget the gasp - inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life . 
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug . 
i took it out for the first time to come here . 
go ! 
should it be by just walking around looking down ? 
this project has lasted now , been just over two years . 
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera . 
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole - hearted living , i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown . 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
and that myth is profoundly dangerous . 
the majority of people . 
the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat . 
shame is one , do not be perceived as what ? 
i was in the third year of my seven - year undergraduate degree . 
i took a couple victory laps in there . 
now fast forward to just three years ago . 
could we have people singing together in real time ? 
and praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that . 
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see . 
what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ? 
on the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence - - all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home . 
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms . 
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism . 
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest . 
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire . 
basically , when i look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn - on across the board . 
radiant , as in self - sustaining . 
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan , lies that movement toward the other . 
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me . 
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ? 
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love - - mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other - - are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire . 
you know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct . 
our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore . 
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end . 
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time . 
are you going to curse me ? are you going to scold me ? 
foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm . 
trees epitomize stasis . 
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree - - which produced this painting - - moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines . 
would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ? 
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce . 
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are - - all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding . 
for one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them . 
but enough of the theory . 
the rocket was huge . 
now we have the good fortune to open up space . 
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns . 
i could have told you 50 others just like it - - all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert . 
shyness is about fear of social judgment . 
and kids are working in countless group assignments . 
even in subjects like math and creative writing , which you think would depend on solo flights of thought , kids are now expected to act as committee members . 
and when it comes to leadership , introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though introverts tend to be very careful , much less likely to take outsize risks - - which is something we might all favor nowadays . 
this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity , because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas , but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them . 
so no wilderness , no revelations . 
so . . . 
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well - managed environment and take it from there . 
underneath this ceremonial role , he was really modest and really introverted - - so much so that when he delivered these sermons , he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years . 
number one : stop the madness for constant group work . 
okay , number two : go to the wilderness . 
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in . 
of course , clubs and discos , too . 
so , as you all know , species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments , and the pressures of those environments selected which changes , through random mutation in species , were going to be preserved . 
and that has been the second great - - couple 100 , 000 years , 150 , 000 years - - flow of our evolution . 
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them . 
and they are now making them , and someday , perhaps pretty soon , you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket . 
but something much , much more powerful is happening now . 
and what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light . 
so they did it with mouse pups , kittens . 
they did it with pigs . 
they did it with puppies . 
and , in fact , they did it with monkeys . 
and if you can do it with monkeys - - though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes - - if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings . 
be easier to find us at night . 
in other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed . 
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create . 
that dna is passed down through our mothers . 
it gets worse than that - - or perhaps better than that . 
the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthetic arm would do . 
and eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves - - which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms . 
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator . 
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being . 
this is where we are in this process . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
but first , my disclosures . 
but that very fact is telling . 
where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire . 
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 . 
but it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre - menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent . 
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system . 
our big break came in 2004 . 
after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology . 
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day . 
so , i started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk . 
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it . 
interestingly , what i did with these rollers is , basically , i took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line . 
so , these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly . 
we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things ; what about that ? 
so , rather than waiting for that , i actually made my own , just using a piece of paper . 
so i now have a print - out of that thing , and now - - the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back , rather than now switching between these two worlds . 
this is incredible , really . 
what are you doing with this ? is there a company being planned ? 
common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt . 
and so for her , i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that & # 91 ; knee & # 93 ; joint space . 
and & # 91 ; the allograft & # 93 ; replaces & # 91 ; the missing meniscus & # 93 ; . 
and so with that , coming to a - - coming to an operating theater near you soon , i believe . 
how are we going to feed this world ? 
you get a new disease that can be deadly . 
well they are . 
they just make it & # 91 ; with & # 93 ; nuts or something . 
1 . 1 million of them . 
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival . 
this is , obviously , that famous view now of the arctic , which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years . very , very , very scary . 
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard . 
we started right there , with absolutely nothing . 
the exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people . 
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited . 
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world . 
and these job losses , we can fix them with green - collar jobs . 
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church . 
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable . 
not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out . 
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink . 
now that can be daunting . 
now my point is the small things matter . 
they are facts about the well - being of conscious creatures . 
now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : this is something that we could be right or wrong about . and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects . 
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind - - neuroscience , psychology , etc . 
but we can ask the obvious question : is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ? 
now , many of you might worry that the notion of well - being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re - construed . 
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : there may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing . 
consider , by analogy , the game of chess . 
but it clearly admits some exceptions . 
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do . 
and yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity . 
how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ? 
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well - being ? 
so , some combustible material there . 
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming - with - rage thing , after as well , some of them . 
language seems to be really important here . 
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face - - i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under . 
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness . 
so , everything is not going to be up for grabs . 
if you get all those parts aligned , yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love . 
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes . 
so effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything . 
dreadful . thumbs down . 
embarrassing . okay , wonderful , great . 
and a lot of us - - and i suspect , especially a lot of us in this room - - deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students , perfectionists , over - achievers . 
they have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly . 
and for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up . 
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings . 
and something else happened instead . 
and something else happened instead . 
and in order to make it even more exciting , he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun , and he brings out the temple vessels . 
and it had to recognize their different habits , different peoples , different religions , different faiths . 
this is heady national rhetoric , and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return . 
any of you get really freaked out by that ? 
you might want to leave now . 
and he was telling me that really , we ought to try and eradicate these things . 
but part of the reason that i found this interesting is that i started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion , and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living - - that are surviving . 
and in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism . 
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways . 
so bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers . 
right . 
they were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week . 
then , collect your cracked nut in safety . 
and since that time , all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior . 
now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off . 
so , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot . 
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way . 
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions . 
so here is the bottom line . 
now here is the net out of this . 
in fact it would be basically nil . 
incidentally , they did pull it off . 
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers . 
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair - - so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors - - so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system . 
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality . 
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance . 
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations - - the hummingbird hawk - moth is beautiful in its adaptation . 
these are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it , the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with . 
so it probably even feels good for the insect , as well as looking good . 
at night they get covered in pollen , which showers down over them , and then the bristles that we saw above , they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out , covered in pollen - - fabulous thing . 
that sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long . 
this thing does something else which is unusual . 
and they get inside , and they get it all on . 
and the plant showers them with pollen , and off they go and pollinate . 
this is what it looks like if you take out the red . 
same with planning . somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution ? 
now , at the end , nonviolent discipline , and this is probably the game - changer . 
now let me move to another place . 
we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used . 
of course , you could bet they have done the most stupid thing : they arrested the barrel . and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car , that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have . 
it can put the price tag of state - sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters . 
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents - - a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified . 
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations , it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do . 
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation . 
so the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future . 
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ? 
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations . 
you need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible . 
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years . 
so my argument today is basically this . 
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors . 
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth . 
and none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her . 
there is nothing wrong with your brain . there is nothing wrong with your mind . 
i work in old - age homes , largely . 
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations . 
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations . 
a lot of them had to do with a car . 
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned . 
and , above all , she would see cartoons . 
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these . 
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully . 
well , yeah , a lot of them . 
but they stop there . 
there , the animal finds a mine . 
the value of nothing : out of nothing comes something . 
and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time i was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different . 
because all i could really do was represent in a very one - on - one way . 
and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book . 
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma . 
that figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age . 
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure . 
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it . 
there was a reason for everything . 
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ? 
how do i , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ? 
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life . 
and they all operate at the same time . 
there is also a big question of ambiguity . 
and ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and i have it . moral ambiguity . 
and they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed . 
and all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response . 
do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it ? 
and then , in a way , i knew that they had always been there . 
and what i need , in effect , is a focus . 
and you are noticing it more often . 
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions . 
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of . 
we come to this point and say , what do i as an individual do ? 
also , i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide . 
it seems so obvious , and yet it is not . 
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know . 
there are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book . 
and i needed to find something historically that would match that . 
you wonder , are these things random chance ? 
a big thing that i also think about is accidents . 
and so i was there on three occasions , different seasons . 
and i began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . and i saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility . 
i have to think of my role . where i am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something i came up with ? 
so , there are never complete answers . 
because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling . 
there she is . 
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format . 
and mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of . 
but like most things in technology and the technology world , hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil . 
hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity . 
the underground railroad was a brilliant hack . 
so keep that in mind . 
now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content . 
i authored this answer , and a few others . 
so when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting , cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government . 
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the house . 
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind - - the images that these thoughts created - - and the action that derived from it . 
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness . 
i needed something that would pull me out of all this . 
i needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that i could go from there . 
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ? 
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ? 
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have . 
so i would drag myself into my dance studio - - body , mind and spirit - - every day into my dance studio , and learn everything i learned when i was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped . 
difficult . 
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , i brought laser - sharp focus into my dance , laser - sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery . 
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist . 
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule . 
as i ride out , as i ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , i want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror . 
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do . 
in fact , i have got qualifications . 
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing . 
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually . 
yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality . 
we will observe this day . 
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least . 
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything . 
and obviously the life - saving is increased , the concepts help . 
norman spack : how i help transgender teens become who they want to be 
i want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you , or if you were delivering , about the person you were delivering . 
now , as a pediatric endocrinologist , i used to be very , very involved , and still somewhat am , in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals , and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex . 
that sometimes shows up in the first decade of life , but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross - gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins . 
but at the time that puberty begins , that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls , 12 to 14 in boys , with breast budding or two to three times increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males , by that particular point , the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings , no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things . 
now this is relatively rare , so i had relatively little personal experience with this , and my experience was more typical only because i had an adolescent practice . 
does this make so - and - so straight ? 
the fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get . 
and they fall apart . 
so this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out , they can have more and more testing , they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them . 
in a crowd . 
they were out there suffering , is where they were . 
they had to homeschool her . 
and yet , she had just begun a male puberty . 
and so here she is at 16 , on the left . 
go figure . 
she has a bit of a form to her . 
so where do we go from here ? 
well , we still have a ways to go in terms of anti - discrimination . 
they cost a fortune . 
this is not that common . 
but the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide , but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society . 
coke is everywhere . 
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing . 
they have this very continuous feedback loop . 
and my answer must at once be , it is no use . 
oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it . 
and i would add a cautionary note here , however . 
in life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and i think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage . 
it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off . 
we then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta . 
happy , away i went . 
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ? 
a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big u . k . charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal . 
it must be rubbish . they binned it . 
and in fact , there are many surgeons in the u . k . 
dead easy to give him respect . 
now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic . 
three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health - and earth - friendly diet . 
seriously . 
they both get it wrong , though . 
now , i know everybody over the age of , like 45 - - their mouths are watering at this point . 
but this may have cut down on housework , but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well . 
not that they were any good , but they were there . 
sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed - - the beginning of the heyday of value - added food , which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it . 
all you do is nuke it . what could be better ? 
and zapped horribly , pathetically . 
can farm - raised salmon be organic , when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet , even if the feed itself is supposedly organic , and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens , swimming in their own filth ? 
we can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so . 
okay , here we go . 
okay , so you smile , frowning . 
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school . 
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around . 
building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand . 
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before . 
could we bring down the lights please ? thank you . 
hey . 
he figured out the system . 
uh oh . 
hey . 
bye - bye . 
so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ 10 , 000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects , i thought they were really well - meaning , but a bit naive . 
we garnered much support along the way . 
why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood ? 
25 percent of us are unemployed . low - income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care . 
poor people are not only still poor ; they are still unhealthy . 
i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down . 
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems . 
and if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community , that is bad and ugly , how could it not reflect on you ? 
he looked at the demographics . 
you , however , are blessed with the gift of influence . 
what troubled me was that this top - down approach is still around . 
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong . 
just look how many . 
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the western population moved over to here . 
so this is where they are today . 
they are now buying cars . 
so there they are . 
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well - educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those & # 91 ; richer also & # 93 ; have . 
but there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying - - there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle . 
and if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology - - so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap - - then they will move all the way up here . 
well , here population & # 91 ; growth & # 93 ; comes in because there & # 91 ; among emerging economies & # 93 ; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end . 
so these & # 91 ; poorest & # 93 ; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion . 
because we already have this & # 91 ; growth & # 93 ; in process . 
but if , and only if , & # 91 ; the poorest & # 93 ; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come & # 91 ; to live & # 93 ; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 . 
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here - - high child - survival , small families - - and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival . 
it can be done . 
this will not happen & # 91 ; again & # 93 ; . 
it was venerable . 
it was ubiquitous . 
well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles . 
how about this week ? 
now , how about your household energy use ? 
anybody check that today ? 
a few energy geeks spread out across the room . 
so what does this tell us ? 
in fact , it already is . 
we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar - sized homes . 
they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it . 
we did everything that letter told us to do , and still i know there must be more . 
thank you . 
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self - stimulatory movements that led them nowhere . 
extremely , extremely isolated . 
now , what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further . 
there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school , you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them , to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly , relentlessly , but often in an awkward fashion , without that immediate resonance . 
well , this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time . 
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat , i can tell you , and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition . 
and we actually have a bit of a question here , because if there are so many different causes of autism , how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome ? because people like myself , when we walk into a playroom , we recognize a child as having autism . 
autism creates itself . 
we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with . 
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory , but in order for us to do that , we had to create these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , how little babies , how newborns , engage with the world , moment by moment , what is important , and what is not . 
well , we created those measures , and here , what you see is what we call a funnel of attention . 
in this scan pass , in green here , are two - year - olds with autism . 
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed , and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers . 
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation . 
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40 , 000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life . 
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications . 
this is a real thing . 
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40 , 000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life . 
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications . 
this is a real thing . 
perhaps a stealth thing . 
there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible . 
so fingers crossed . 
and sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity . 
i just become skanky . 
so there you are . 
no fighting , ladies . 
and then i just threw some typography on it . 
seriously . 
yes . it can , it does and it will , but for this book designer , page - turner , dog - eared place - holder , notes in the margins - taker , ink - sniffer , the story looks like this . 
and it is . 
i suffered a lot as a mother . 
you have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous . 
you must be tolerant . 
so really , any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian . 
i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution . 
on the weekend , your choice . 
so you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish . 
this is the forensic anthropology research facility , and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition . 
they carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations , and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability . 
and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment . 
they flip the negative . 
it runs 24 hours a day , commercial free . 
he is photographed at his alibi location . 
now the brain may not look like much from the outside - - a couple pounds of pinkish - gray flesh , amorphous - - but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within . 
now in the 20th century , there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders , and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders , practically none of them can be considered to be cured . 
so when i started in neuroscience 11 years ago , i had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist , and the first thing i thought about was , if these neurons are electrical devices , all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance . 
so this turned out to be very simple to do . 
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability . 
instead of one point in the brain , we can devise devices that span the brain , that can deliver light into three - dimensional patterns - - arrays of optical fibers , each coupled to its own independent miniature light source . 
this tone used to mean bad news . 
now i want to close on one story , which we think is another possibility - - which is that maybe these molecules , if you can do ultra - precise control , can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic , an optical prosthetic . 
the photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top , and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom , the ganglion cells , relay the information to the brain , where we see that as perception . 
now how could you repair this ? 
now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute - force search . 
and our hope is that , by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them , we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier , practically none of which are cured , and in the 21st century make them history . 
right , yeah . 
also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider . 
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board , there is a lot of force , a lot of power . 
if i put some tension on my body , tension on my suit , i can make it fly . and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface . 
of being in free fall , with all the visual references . 
the special thing on these three jumps were , i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day . 
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge . 
i think we all might have some questions . 
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ? 
all right . well we will watch this space . but i have two more questions . 
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards . 
people would yell at me from their passing cars . 
it was consistent . 
so after all of our shows , we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people , and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us , and i would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows , and they would pass the hat , and then they would come in and join us onstage , so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird , random circus guests . 
this is this . 
i maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing . 
it felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat . 
and what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone . 
you take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result . 
a real - world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result . 
what the hell ? 
all countries spy . 
so once again , we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose , making all of us less secure as an outcome . 
and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the e . u . conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ? 
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the united states . 
how do you do that ? 
the solution is open source . 
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear . 
so i got inspired by that . 
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them . 
the lower level employees thought it was very funny . 
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags . 
in my previous life , i was an artist . 
there was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident , or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star . 
the french e . u . official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting . 
and when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people . 
one day i remember walking along a street that had just been colored , and where we were in the process of planting trees , when i saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop . 
crime did fall . 
the paint on the walls did not feed children , nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant , but it gave hope and light , and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things , a different spirit , a different feel to our lives , and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics , we could build a better life for each other and for our country . 
by means of open competitions , we managed to recruit in our administration many young people , and we thus managed to build a de - politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented . 
can i ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something - - a movie , an album , a song or a book - - and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ? 
and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u . s . today . 
they lack retention ; you find yourself re - explaining concepts three months later , wholesale . 
you expect sitcom - sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track . 
so 90 percent of what i do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving . 
and because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it . 
and that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , i teach kids - - because of my inexperience - - i teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ? 
but here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition . 
it has not had the impact that these other companies have had . 
those colorful , out - of - the - box kind of thinkers . 
right ? i mean , the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum , or something . 
what actually makes your phone a smartphone , basically , instead of a stupid phone ? 
so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs , whereas the slight variations of existing drugs - - viagra , different color , different dosage - - are the less revolutionary ones . 
it was even , god forbid , being a venture capitalist . 
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations . 
but perhaps even more important , we heard before about the one percent , the 99 percent . 
so whatever it was , it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way . 
the area near these walls , which nobody bothers to pay attention to , had been left free from major intervention , and this is where i first found my treasures . 
when i went on school field trips , family vacations , or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes , i wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked inside my school bag . 
through bowmaking , i came in contact with part of my heritage . 
no , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind . 
erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog . 
but even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . you know ? 
they use it synecdochically . 
and i absolutely love the periodic table . 
and this is pretty easy biotechnology . 
the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery . 
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward . 
so this is a virus - based solar cell . 
but i actually walked away with a great job offer . 
and there was a little - - an interesting theory about abstraction . 
i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins . 
come back down , you weigh twice as much . 
you do it again and again . 
we set up a whole er . 
once he was there , & # 91 ; we & # 93 ; let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like . 
so we did a second parabola . 
i took off my yarmulke , because i had no medical equipment , and with a lot of pressure , i stopped his bleeding . 
now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly . 
there are just way too few eye care professionals . 
how do you distribute ? how do you work out how to fit the thing ? 
how do you deal with the industry ? 
let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground . 
the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit . 
i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today . 
the way the tv - industrial complex works , is you buy some ads - - interrupt some people - - that gets you distribution . 
well , this tv - industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours . 
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way . 
they would ignore the geeks , and god forbid , the laggards . 
they got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable . 
a couple of quick rules to wrap up . 
for the people who were there and looking at that section , it was remarkable . 
because he did something that was at the fringes . 
so what you need to do is figure out who does care . 
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us . 
other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling . 
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly . 
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor - - equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you . 
but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well - being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability . 
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ? 
the people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them . 
there is the idea of hitting the wall , that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse . 
people have a huge amount of fun doing this , reconnecting with other people as they do it . 
there was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy . 
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff . 
another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan , which is basically to develop a plan b for the town . 
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions . 
and by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the oil age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other . 
for once , your incentives are aligned . 
in most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries . 
it varies a bit province to province . 
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges . 
has about one - third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of . 
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one - in - three chance of developing diabetes . 
it no longer just makes sense . 
it turns out , all sorts of things . 
now , during the boom , there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density , a sort of compact , walkable urban neighborhoods . 
plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped . 
transit is a big driver of retrofits . 
this was a very large mall on a hundred - acre superblock . 
here was the mall in its heyday . 
they had their prom in the mall . they loved their mall . 
but densification is not going to work everywhere . 
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit . 
we need to be able to target which areas really should be re - greened . 
they are new but trying to look old . 
the fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks , the streets and blocks , the putting in of public space , compromised as it may be , is still a really great thing . 
but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to . 
so often the men are gone . 
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care . 
they go shopping for all sorts of things . 
the more attractive she finds him , the more sex they have ; the more sex they have , the nicer he is to her ; the nicer he is to her , the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed - - and ultimately , they live happily ever after . 
in other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department . 
yeah . 
and he kind of nodded , you know ? 
and that always stuck with me all my life . 
you see this little pattern here ? 
you feel for them . 
ten variations . this is , like , spin the letter around . 
how many coffees do you have ? 
what is the tenor of their email ? how is it working out ? 
we have a big problem . 
then we were victims of the french . 
hold on ! wait a minute ! 
the problem is not the things we feel victims of . 
the first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy . 
daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances . 
less safe ! 
i will follow the instructions , the tempo markings , the dynamics . 
snares on , snares off . 
and so on . my career would probably last about five years . 
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum . 
not just translate them , but interpret them . 
and so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums - - in particular , the kettle drums , or tympani - - to such a narrow pitch interval , so something like . . . 
that of a difference . then gradually . . . and gradually . . . 
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs - - they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand . 
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry . 
so it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work . 
so to find an actual hall is incredible - - for which you can play exactly what you imagine , without it being cosmetically enhanced . 
it may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . that , to them , means they can walk . 
and please try to create that through your clapping . try . just - - please try . 
rain . not bad . not bad . 
turned it upside down , experimented with the shell , experimented with the head . 
experimented with my body , experimented with jewelry , experimented with all sorts of things . 
and of course , i returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that - - but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ? 
so we never , ever dealt with actual study books . 
and by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people . 
and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout . 
of those 85 takes , only three actually successfully completed their run . 
and we learned that small stuff stinks . 
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust , and they fall out of the tracks , the exact angles makes it hard to get right . 
but as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go . 
thank you very much . 
let me start again . 
dogs . 
is there more energy coming in than going out ? 
if so , more warming is in the pipeline . 
but that lag is exactly what is expected . 
the physics does not change . 
what sea level rise can we look forward to ? 
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business - as - usual fossil fuel use . 
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate , giving talks in 10 countries , getting arrested , burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over 30 years ? 
more grandchildren helped me along . 
so now you know what i know that is moving me to sound this alarm . 
thank you . 
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf . 
do you have a need for speed ? 
an olive server . 
some type of extension pole - - like what the painters use . 
shape - retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . contrast that with a plastic garbage can - - and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back . 
and he kind of comically explained that time after time , what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ; if there were no dead policemen , it was ok to go . 
in what i call the flushed - and - plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke . 
there is now a new career path called stool donor . 
i tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings i liked or not . 
and i put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on . 
i got into fish . 
and after i got - - i was really drunk - - i was asked to do some sketches on napkins . 
the thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat . 
so . . . 
toxic waste , i guess , is the key clue to that one . 
it was a joke . 
the whole thing about my house , the whole use of rough carpentry and everything , was the frustration with the crafts available . 
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle . 
instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 . 
the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building . 
i just joined the points . 
i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that . 
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it . 
i keep trying to make it work . 
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries . 
i locked the house into the site by cutting the back end - - here you see on the photographs of the site - - slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall , creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom , which i designed like a kind of a barge , looking like a boat . 
and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table . 
kind of a fun thing to do . 
and i struggled with that thing - - how to get around the corner . 
and so it will be quite a different shape . 
but this is how i do work . i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away . 
sometimes school is under a tree , or in many cases , the teacher has only a fifth - grade education , so you need a collaborative model of learning , not just building more schools and training more teachers , which you have to do anyway . 
affirmative action is not very popular frankly , with white voters , period . 
i can , however , give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have . 
or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder . 
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease . 
it did not evolve for natural survival . 
now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction . 
the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water in a bluish distance , indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally - - get this - - a path or a road , perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline , that extends into the distance , almost inviting you to follow it . 
they go back about two - and - a - half - million years . 
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship . 
but still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances . 
now you say , really ? 
they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency , but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence , no longer a dependence upon the people alone , increasingly a dependence upon the funders . 
it blocks the right too , as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible . 
because there is an economy here , an economy of influence , an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization . 
it feeds on dysfunction . 
okay , now , every single one of you knows this . 
you focus on the possible problems , like eradicating polio from the world , or taking an image of every single street across the globe , or building the first real universal translator , or building a fusion factory in your garage . 
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption . 
yours is the most important issue , but mine is the first issue , the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about . 
no sensible reform , and we cannot afford a world , a future , with no sensible reform . 
now i get this skepticism . 
change the incentives , and the behavior changes , and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice . 
do you have that love ? 
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand . 
and the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow , and when they die , their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand , things like coral and so forth . 
so sort of left - eye view , right - eye view . 
okay . 
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing . 
and these are flytrap anemones . 
it produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense . 
but if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue . 
so this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark . 
injury crashes have dropped 76 percent , fatal crashes down 90 percent . 
but the other two are somewhat questionable . 
can that be accomplished with existing signs ? 
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs . 
that would not work . 
so , i was able to completely daydream my way through my life . 
and so what happened was that i started just becoming an editorial illustrator through , you know , sheer whatever , sheer ignorance . 
and i - - and my full - time job , i landed the best job on earth , was to daydream , and to actually come up with absurd ideas that - - fortunately , there were enough people there , and it was a team , it was a collective , it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas . 
you have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually . 
so , i get to put in all of the things that i love . 
too many pogroms . 
facts were actually banished from our home . 
well , not so awful . 
or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying ? 
this is what that looked like . 
the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question . 
you know the sawing - the - lady - in - half trick ? 
yes . 
everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? ok . 
this is change - blindness . 
no trouble there . 
can everybody see ? all right . 
audience : yes . 
it was incredibly successful . 
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes . 
that will not succeed . 
nobody has claimed credit for that . 
there is no plan b right now . 
in some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery . 
and they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement . 
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement . 
by measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution . 
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity - led science and exploration . 
that funds everything in the u . k . 
is there any other use to exploration and science , other than just a sense of wonder ? 
and it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas . 
the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam . 
he was clearly under assault all the time . 
it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold . 
and even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole . 
but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang . 
are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ? 
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there . 
so then it was my turn , and somehow , i get myself onto the stage , i start my song , i open my mouth to sing the first line , and this completely horrible vibrato - - you know , when your voice wavers - - comes streaming out . 
and something good did happen - - i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for . 
and then i could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease . 
would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you ? 
so what do artists do ? well , what artists do is to measure . 
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious . . . 
and bingo . that is all you have to do . 
and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science . 
but the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out . 
no matter what the shapes were , the growth law is the same . 
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first - order discrete differential equation and a second - order discrete differential equation , derived by six - year - olds . 
and i can try steering the car here by . . . 
see the car turn by five here ? 
so what if i click this down to zero ? 
student 1 : ooh , this is nice . 
teacher : drop . class : whoa ! 
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase . 
now , what if we want to look at this more closely ? 
and how shall we look and verify that we actually have it ? 
they take you to gruff - ex - cop - on - his - fourth - marriage . dad . 
my train was a heart attack . 
because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this . 
okay , i spent 25 years , in my middle - age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that . 
it was insidious and it was really happening . 
well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here . 
oh , not so lucky . 
this might be what we end up with . 
or i could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company . 
now , we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle - - the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices , the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing , and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors . 
except maybe french people . 
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment . 
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other . 
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life . 
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway . 
they are not meant to stay . 
so the reactions in the street were kind of interesting . 
and the army took them , and instead of bringing them to the police station , they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces . 
we kept traveling . 
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor . 
so the people kept it . 
but they asked me for a promise basically . 
so we start by brewing the tea . 
so this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing . 
and this is a static culture . 
using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning . 
it was an astronomy book , and i poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft . 
these are a number of our science space earth orbiters . 
all right , so what about the rest of it ? 
you can manipulate it yourself . 
we cannot get medicine to them reliably , they cannot get critical supplies , and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income . 
imagine this scenario . 
what would you do today ? 
well , you would place a request via mobile phone , and someone would get the request immediately . 
and the third is the operating system that manages the whole network . 
these fly autonomously . 
every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism , so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations , they dock , swap a battery automatically , and go out again . 
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network . 
it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions , avoid other risk factors , and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network . 
well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars . 
what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests , astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees , voodoo dolls , fireflies , chocolate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball , it would be as smooth as a billiard ball , presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle . 
and so this starting material is back to the basic building block . 
so we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there . 
so as you see the film go in transparently through there , and then . . . 
and then you go a little crazy , and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays , like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes . 
or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make . 
so you think of alternative mechanical parts . 
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted . 
and so what you see there is the difference . 
the hypothalamus , the part of the brain that regulates body weight , there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight , more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it , and the system works like a thermostat , responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger , activity and metabolism , to keep your weight stable as conditions change . 
several long - term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders . 
it takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project , and because willpower is limited , any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else . 
and so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device . 
say a new super bug has emerged . 
and this was the big story of the day at that time . 
they enter the queue , they just zip right out . 
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there . 
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment . 
and this is just the same . 
just have a look at the demographics in the u . s . here . 
in 2010 , two workers per retiree in the u . s . 
there are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging . 
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention . 
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body . 
so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound - healing mechanisms . 
and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself . 
could you regenerate a limb ? 
this is clinically relevant today . 
he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish . 
this was a randomized trial . 
these are now two years out . 
there go the cells . 
so you could go in , you could get your tummy - tuck . 
this is equally tragic . 
everything that is done to treat burn - - basically we do a sodding approach . 
we make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take . 
so my 18 minutes is up . 
clearly the images kind of get that across . 
and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along . 
but there were problems . 
how did look at the stuff in your life ? 
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered . 
so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ? 
and they even have different colors . 
plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range . 
now while this may be the low - economic - cost solution , this is certainly not the low - environmental or human health - and - safety solution . 
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way . 
so about 20 years ago , i literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world . 
and we eventually broke the code . 
we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment . 
in the short time period i have , i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this . 
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately . 
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi - step separation process begins . 
we push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti - like plastic strands . 
so now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home . 
we took our clues from mother nature . 
the u . n . wanted to rush people and supplies to the area . 
but help was coming . 
and it took them four days . 
in fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking - - some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth . 
none of them are taught in cooking schools . 
and the hope was two - fold . 
but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical , maybe a little bit more scientific , maybe a little bit more chef - y than they otherwise would have . 
and one of our canning cutaways . 
in most cases , though , there was no glass . 
like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue . 
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it . 
the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it . 
now this was revolutionary . 
the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static . 
here it is . 
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small . 
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory . 
now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one - by - one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe . 
the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes . 
i suspect the latter . 
it appears that it may not always be that way . 
how do you think of where cosmology is now , in a sort of historical side ? 
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ? 
and i thought , go figure . 
now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move , but a composer is considering all possible moves , testing them out , prioritizing them out , until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness . 
he came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this . 
and i thought , my god , how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed , across the room to recover the memory of this music that , after everything else in his life is sloughing away , still means so much to him ? 
maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results . 
even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation , less rigorous ethical reviews , and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure . 
the first of these is informed consent . 
if you are a researcher , i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience , to remain ethical in your research , and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers . 
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves . 
most old people in the u . s . end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends . 
at the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people . 
whatever food is available has to be reserved for able - bodied adults and for children . 
they are fed . they remain valuable . 
one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food . 
another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren . 
cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the u . s . 
there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u . s . 
changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past . 
yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce , carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self - esteem associated with work . 
the slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old , but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later . 
what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u . s . , and to make better use of their value ? 
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high - quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full - time caretakers of their children . 
a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology . 
at the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back . 
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back . 
paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before . 
the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom - - a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies , clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots , leaving clean compost . 
first , a burial suit infused with mushroom spores , the mushroom death suit . 
and at last , we appear to be doing something about it . 
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it . 
she , better than most , knew the power of an image . 
and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something . 
and that question cleared the space . 
and i have that kind of flash sometimes . 
now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like . 
and she was next door to a very wealthy , oil - rich neighbor . 
had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it . 
she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game . 
so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat . 
by the third sentence , she was in tears . 
i was in tears . 
and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding . 
if only . 
what would it be like to be improving the human lot ? 
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck . 
more is bad . 
i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing . 
in the u . k . , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do - - never my best thing . 
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important - - learning throughout the whole life course . 
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people . 
now , he was a preacher , but i believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the promised land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want . 
well , it has its pluses and minuses . 
that is our regime , our government - - our atrocious government , & # 91 ; that & # 93 ; has done every crime in order to stay in power . 
we pose a threat to the order of the government . 
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse - - the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty . 
now i am making films . 
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art - - to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art . 
how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work . 
so , we have two panels here , of colored dots . 
and you have to tell me which one . 
here is the green one . 
so , if i could have the lights down up here . 
can i have the lights up again ? 
and yet there is still one on a dark surround and one on a light surround . 
why ? because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective - - just the laws of physics . 
and here she comes down the ladder . 
he finds it . amazing . right ? 
and now , when i tell people what i do , they move toward me . 
and the third problem about the disease model is , in our rush to do something about people in trouble , in our rush to do something about repairing damage , it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier , positive interventions . 
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage . 
about 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy . 
now obviously she failed . 
but what she did was to take her highest strengths , and re - craft work to use them as much as possible . 
this is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally . 
and meaning , in this view , consists of - - very parallel to eudaimonia - - it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are . 
and what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set . 
and we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ? 
and it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery . 
and there was a drunk man on there , and he got up out of his seat two or three times , and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do . 
i talk ad lib . 
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality . 
was there a god ? 
he put it on a personal basis . 
how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying ? 
or he was insane . 
or he was what he claimed to be . 
which was he ? 
well actually , i hope for a while longer yet . 
and of course , the u . k . benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth . 
after all , the best education - - according to the latest world university rankings - - is to be found in the universities of the u . k . and the u . s . 
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ? 
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species . 
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants . 
our cities , i would put to you , are stockpiles of these surplus capacities . 
we have visions like this . we have visions like this . 
the wisdom lives inside of them . 
and the girls decided to make it an annual event . 
because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives . 
and most of those losses are because of things we know . 
and this flu has wiped through the population of bees . 
but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous . 
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the national guard would be out . 
and you can install this in your hive and replace that dead - out . 
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his veil , which he used as a screening , right in this meadow . and so that ingenuity is inspiring . 
but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees . 
and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined . 
white - nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats . 
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too . 
namaste . good morning . 
i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race . 
where we have now come to live in a world where the most horrific poverty , genocide , mass rapes , the destruction of the earth , is completely out of control . 
so , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening . 
their stories were so horrific , and so mind - blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered . 
my mind was so shattered . 
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened . 
that shattering , that opening of my girl cell , that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous , and braver , and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life . 
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire - building is actually - - that feelings get in the way of empire - building . 
i see how boys have been brought up , and i see this across the planet : to be tough , to be hardened , to distance themselves from their tenderness , to not cry . 
we silence them . we make them feel guilty for being smart . we get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense . 
we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities . 
but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24 , they are they key , really , in the developing world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of humanity . 
the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings , which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers . 
and she was holding her baby . 
she went to school and she found her voice , and she found her identity , and she found her heart . 
then , her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation , after a year . 
in that hut , we walked in , and her father and his four wives were sitting there , and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled , and her primary mother , who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders . 
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying . 
there is a particular way of knowing . 
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ? 
can you say it with me ? 
the punch line ? 
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , births , strokes , heart disease , hip replacements , 4 a . m . emergencies . 
a time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings . 
for a time that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press - - across a lot of different media from a lot of big names . 
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ? 
hs : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait - - let me see if i got this straight . 
rives : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . 
parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want . 
you could do the whole thing with addition . 
here , we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will , but capable of only two ideas . 
the instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail . 
the essentials were all there - - all the things that make these machines run . 
the machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations . 
this is hackers getting in trouble for the first time . 
the input and the output was by teletype tape at first . 
burning lots of midnight oil . 
he had a wonderful rapport . 
even errors were duplicated . 
it was published in the literature . 
and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike , or a new kind of life . 
so there it is , 50 years later , sitting there - - sort of suspended animation . 
these cards , now , thanks to me showing up , are being saved . 
he was thinking far ahead , to how this would really grow into a new kind of life . 
and we owe a tremendous credit to that . 
this is neat . 
the new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun . 
yeah ! yeah . 
oh well , different story . 
buy it anyway . 
intense fear paralyzes you . 
now some people can - - circus workers , steel workers . 
biology - - we have co - adapted through biology to like bright colors . 
cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it - - saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax . 
the other neat thing . . . 
to get that device just below the tabletop . 
that is actually the device . 
there might be somebody on one right now , participating in multi - dimensional engagement . 
this one i love . 
this is the sound of one hand clapping . 
now , that fascinated me endlessly as a child , but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time . 
but how would you actually go about testing such a theory ? 
over 25 years that has huge long - run effects on the wealth of your nation . 
and most granularly , i break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world - - so an extreme level of granularity . 
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of . 
they simply go through their lives getting on with it . 
they get no great pleasure from what they do . 
that there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are . 
and many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries . 
now , doing this is easier said than done . 
how many of you here are over the age of 25 ? 
ask a room full of teenagers the same thing . 
and the reason is , you see , that we were brought up in a pre - digital culture , those of us over 25 . 
one of them is the idea of linearity : that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right , you will end up set for the rest of your life . 
but , you know , we have become obsessed with this linear narrative . 
i think we are obsessed with getting people to college . 
certain sorts of college . 
this linearity thing is a problem . 
in a way , it did not for me . 
and you cannot predict the outcome of human development . 
and i wanted to just very quickly . . . 
and we should tread softly . 
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms . 
her body was riddled with secondary tumors . 
the next slide is going to be gruesome . 
think about that for a minute . 
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else . 
and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe , you know , in his brain something was stirring , some sort of musical gift . 
now , not being able to see meant , of course , that you taught yourself . 
now then . 
well done . 
two billion people without sanitation . 
and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable . 
we have not had an idea . 
it could be at one dollar ; it could be 1 , 000 dollars . 
they make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ? 
or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ? 
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of & # 91 ; million & # 93 ; people get infected every year . 
that would be the second best investment that we could do . 
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate . 
i find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that . 
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good . 
do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich dutch guy ? 
so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight . 
so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities . 
i should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ? 
they all come out with very much the same list . 
and that gives me great hope , really , in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ? 
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to . 
each one of those lives matters a lot . 
so we really can make changes . 
so it was absolutely gigantic . 
and two tools helped bring the death rate down . 
and rich men are afflicted . 
but , malaria - - even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact . 
and so you end up with two choices . 
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication . 
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things . 
it involves communicators to keep the funding high , to keep the visibility high , to tell the success stories . 
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise . 
we need rich - world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things . 
there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places . 
and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you measure them against the other top 20 percent . 
now , the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis , but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting . 
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year . 
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this . 
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing . 
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile - - the very best - - and the bottom quartile . 
because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension . 
the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system . 
the teacher was running around , and the energy level was high . 
and i thought it was so fantastic . 
i will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum . 
i know intimately that skin you are hitting . 
i will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing . 
life is a right , not collateral or casual . 
gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing . 
our humming will be drumming . 
i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat . 
a bunch of pacifists . 
confused , aspiring pacifists . 
all holy history banned . 
whose son shall it be ? 
we cherish corpses . 
we mourn women , complicated . 
profits made , prophets ignored . 
war and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods . 
rhythm is half silence . 
i see now , i never was one and not the other . 
i think now i never was pure . 
human contracted itself blind , malignant . 
i never was pure . 
girl spoiled before ripened . 
i experience exponentially . 
cluster bombs left behind . 
de facto landmines . 
harvest contaminated tobacco . 
harvest bombs . 
harvest baby teeth . 
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights . 
it makes you a little nauseous . 
one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure . 
so now , how is that ? 
that very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness . 
there are some which are adverse to this well - being . 
just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature . 
all the nominal connections , in numbers and quantities , were thought - - until the last 20 years - - thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age . 
if you see a comic movie , you go off to the left side . 
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever . 
and jumping monks of tibet . 
let me show you what it looks like . 
for instance , what if i could use this data to find out how relaxed i am at any moment ? 
if you nod off , the system would know , dimming to darkness as you do . 
that you could know something about yourself . 
perhaps even more importantly , thought - controlled computing can give children with add insights into their own fluctuating mental states , so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs . 
but they understood something more fundamental - - the sheer joy in discovery , the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it , the richness that we get from seeing , feeling and knowing the lives that we are . 
so where does this lead ? 
by buying a space that was 420 sq . ft . 
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly . 
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers . 
the course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset . 
but i want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per month , in india and china , when will that have reached that of u . k . and the united states ? 
those are nice words . but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom . 
but really , really natural sovereignty was good for japan . 
and the second world war was really a terrible event , also economically for japan . 
what happens in the after independence ? 
there they are today . 
if you have a lot inequity , macro - geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living . 
whereas u . k . and united states is getting richer and richer . 
and after second world war , united states is richer than u . k . 
look at , look at the united states . 
you see it came down there . 
they seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know . 
you see , japan did it like that . 
can you see here what japan did ? 
japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high - income economies . 
but the real projections for those ones , i would like to give it like this . 
inequalities in china and india i consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population . 
this is a thousand - year - old drawing of the brain . 
because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell , that cell will glow green - - or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein , you get a cell to glow many different colors . 
and instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch , there were these ready - made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all . 
now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone , but they are even more surprised when i tell them how affordable these components are . 
now these models are not just visually appealing , but they are also geometrically accurate , which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees , calculate surface area , the volume of vegetation , and so on , all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests . 
medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer , and the problem is , as we age , our organs tend to fail more , and so currently there are not enough organs to go around . 
so this is now a public health crisis . 
or we can use both . 
and that really has to do to many different challenges . 
but if i were to point to three challenges , the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time . 
and many advances now , we can do that fairly readily . 
you saw the spray going in . 
that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure , this tubularized structure , which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so . 
so they know what to do . 
we then tease the cells apart , we grow the cells outside the body . 
we then take a scaffold , a biomaterial - - again , looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt - - we then shape that material , and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time - - very much like baking a layer cake , if you will . 
we then put it in this oven - like device . 
and we then can re - perfuse the liver with cells , preserving the blood vessel tree . 
and we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology . 
and this is actually new technology still under development . 
so this is more challenging - - large organ , vascular , a lot of blood vessel supply , a lot of cells present . 
we then are able to actually image those , do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form . 
so we go layer by layer through the organ , analyzing each layer as we go through the organ , and we then are able to send that information , as you see here , through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient . 
this actually shows the actual printer . 
and this actually shows that printing . 
put a pair of gloves here . 
has a little bit of consistency to it . 
this is actually the printer that you see here onstage . 
i was missing school . it was pretty much miserable . 
i felt so sick . 
i went through about 16 surgeries , and it seemed impossible to do that when i was in kidney failure when i was 10 . 
are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work ? 
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other . 
so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that . 
and if you put them together in different combinations - - just like printing in a sense , like how a magazine color is printed - - and put them under certain forces , which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them , these amazing things started appearing . 
and they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open . 
there are lines in front of the one on the right , and there are lines behind the one on the left , and so it takes it into different planes . 
like the occurrence of moire patterns . 
it just has so much in it . 
we traveled the country . 
in 1973 , i made my first trip to china . 
there were hardly any cars . 
and with it , comes congestion , and we lose mobility , and so on and so forth . 
could we make it more affordable ? 
we came up with a number of models : economy models , cheaper to build and more compact ; membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens . 
and most important , permeable , open . 
and i want to touch on one more issue , which is the design of the public realm . 
good morning . 
but no faces ? 
his contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here - - en face or three - quarters . 
well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three - quarters . 
so we can eliminate all the profiles . 
so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized . 
so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures . 
and look what happens - - only three candidates remain that fit the bill . 
but there are 1 , 100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces . 
and hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well - developed chin . 
the young man should be made first . 
and as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case . 
yes , it does . he was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made . 
well , we need a reference . 
and before i knew it , i was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me . 
we have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks - and - mortar place for all of our care , because these places are often the wrong tool , and the most expensive tool , for the job . 
and i have these palpitations that are showing up . 
and i tell you , this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game - changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime . 
it flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall . 
what you see over here , this is what we want to do next . 
what you see over here , this yellow thing , this is not a death ray . 
we are literally re - inventing the wheel here . 
so , it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things . 
and also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine . 
so , this is some of the early feasibility experiments . 
we do something to something and just like magic , it moves . the blob . 
the best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype . 
this was in 2004 ; at that time , this was something really , really revolutionary . 
so , really , we have five secrets . 
and so , 4 am in the morning , what do you expect , right ? 
so , we gather around , we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it . 
so , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up . 
well , actually , there are two sides to the story . 
so , there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition . 
this picture in the back this is 3 a . m . in the morning . 
now , 1986 . 
so there is some sort of justice in the world after all . 
same thing with every single password and so on . 
you just have to believe me , it is , it is . 
but just keep staring at it . 
well in most cases it never gets this far . 
and this really is something which creates completely new problems for us . 
what we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs - - these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks . 
we have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity . 
and he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky , and where you can experience the sun , that give us a better life in the built environment , just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows . 
what it all boils down to is , of course , the sun . 
they created this shade that you can see here , which actually covers the sun , but opens up to the good light from the sky . 
and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quantitative , as well as qualitative , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture . 
this is , i think , a very illustrative image of what i try to say - - that the beautiful dynamics of sun , bringing these into the building , creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives . 
it has only on one side this big , big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range . 
so it can be very dim over there , and you do your work , and it can be very bright over there , and you do your work . 
but actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull , and therefore helps us to enhance our lives . 
i really owe a short introduction of this man to you . 
and it is all about this planet . 
but when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this . 
it never reaches the ground where it was meant for . 
it never is to the benefit of people . 
how do we tackle things like mobility ? 
and i will very quickly show you how it works . 
so just to explain . 
we can go further . 
and i will very quickly show you how it works . 
so just to explain . 
we can go further . 
even in the oceans , we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well - being . 
i think , when i see it , i start to think , who are those people ? 
so i give you this wonderful , informative image of the sky , ranging from the inner city , where you may see one or two stars and nothing else , all the way to the rural environments , where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars . 
thank you very much . 
so this takes care of my age . 
so how can you , without drying up , make things with the same pleasure , as a gift to others , for so long ? 
after that , it had to be kneaded . it had to then go in , kind of , a mangle . 
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory . 
and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on . 
they just grow and divide , and grow and divide - - so a kind of boring life , except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters . 
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life . 
but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well . 
the question we had is how could they do anything at all ? 
what was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light , but when the bacteria made light . 
why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous , glow - in - the - dark bacterium that lives in the ocean - - all bacteria have systems like this . 
they vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote . 
what they do , we now understand , is they get in you , they wait , they start growing , they count themselves with these little molecules , and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together , they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host . 
we also then went to look at what are these molecules - - these were the red triangles on my slides before . 
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages . 
so these are private , secret conversations . 
then again we turn to chemistry , and we figured out what this generic molecule is - - that was the pink ovals on my last slide , this is it . 
but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well . 
by targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species - specific , or disease - specific , anti - quorum sensing molecules . 
what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium - - a multi - drug - resistant pathogenic bacterium - - in the same time we give our anti - quorum sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives . 
i hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works - - i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child . 
thanks . 
so , create . so what are some of the people that are using these kind of tools ? 
tremendous , tremendous use . 
what about copying , reusing , right ? 
this costs , anybody guess ? 
ok , so what are the enablers ? 
even the three wise men . 
behind that is the legal code , so if you want to very carefully construct it , and creative commons is taking off - - over 43 million things out there , licensed with a creative commons license . 
so i did some research . 
and i found that there was an historic precedence . 
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now . 
there were definitely hang - out spots . 
but some were for working , some were for playing , some were for guys to collect their things . 
it has no nails or screws . 
but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional - size boxing ring inside . 
and so there is a good reason for this . 
so , as i came to the end of my journey , i found over 50 spaces . 
and they were unexpected and they were surprising . 
but they were also - - i was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them . 
so the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space . 
you really are alive right here in this moment . 
see , these are all right inside of the color palette . 
the texture changed in the drums this time . 
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it . 
you have some people who do . 
but what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities . 
ready , just play some time . 
and just as everybody got excited about it , bang ! 
and he thought about it , and he went to his deep freezer , minus 20 degrees centigrade , and he poured through everything in the freezer , and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs . 
this was very exciting , but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work , because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it , cryoprotectants , to look after it when it was frozen . 
what we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation . 
and then again . and pretty soon , we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those . 
and crocodiles were not behaving at that time either . 
but what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines . 
climate change has affected the world for a long period of time , and gradually , the forests disappeared , the country began to dry out , and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline , until by five million years ago , only one left . 
that was not what happened , actually . 
have a look at this bit of film footage . 
does it have to stay this way ? 
the guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup and they pickled it in alcohol . 
i put a team together . 
so we got it . 
critics of this project say , hang on . 
they give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean . 
you know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ? 
he led them around on a rope . 
at any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remembered , was the hut , and tears came into his eyes . 
and he told me , as it all was flooding back in memories . 
the grasslands were sweeping away . 
and the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around . 
some of the thylacines that were being turned into zoos , sanctuaries , even at the museums , had collar marks on the neck . 
the issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent . 
before going further , let me give you a crash course in plant biology . 
only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant . eighty - five percent is lost . 
eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost . 
basically , we get it out of mines . 
what you are seeing here is an open - pit mine in the u . s . , and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine , if you look in the top right - hand corner , the little crane you can see , that is a giant crane . 
so that really puts it into perspective . 
this graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today . 
do we have a solution ? 
the plant is only able to seek out soluble forms . 
the mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use . 
mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other . 
mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years , and it has even helped modern - day plant species to diversify . 
to the first son , he left half the camels . 
you get 17 . 
well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities , someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush , and then everyone sits around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk . 
well that system is , i think , probably the system that kept us alive to this point , given our human tendencies . 
the conversation got back on track . 
stories matter . as an anthropologist , i know that . 
and what he stood for was unity , the unity of the family . 
we did our due diligence . 
only she became pregnant all the same . 
they are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities , even their appearance . 
couples who are looking for greater happiness , greater sexual happiness in their married lives , but are at a loss of how to achieve it , especially wives , who are afraid of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom . 
the right to express our ideas freely , to marry whom we choose , to choose our own partners , to be sexually active or not , to decide whether to have children and when , all this without violence or force or discrimination . 
but at this critical moment in history , if we do not anchor freedom and justice , dignity and equality , privacy and autonomy in our personal lives , in our sexual lives , we will find it very hard to achieve in public life . 
are they a potential mate ? are they a potential networking opportunity ? 
we do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them . 
the boxes are too narrow . 
i mean , who knows , right ? 
in fact , no one in my life knew that i was a girl - - not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that i worked with . 
i felt like i was performing this elaborate act . 
and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that i was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character . 
it might give them pause . 
we are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded . 
visibility really is key . 
in fact , on the contrary , it highlights them . 
and i watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me . 
of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced . 
the most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : if you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between . 
and the reality that this presents is a complicated one . 
is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ? 
so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ? 
am i the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ? 
thank you . 
so this was the thinking back then , and these individuals made these holes . 
sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because , you can tell that the holes are made partially and then , i think , there was some trepanation , and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole , and we know they survived these procedures . 
and when things work well , then the nervous system works well , and everything functions . 
and this works like that , instantly . 
and the difference between shaking in this way and not - - the difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of 25 , 000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus . 
there are eight children in the family . 
five of them have dystonia . 
so here he is . 
this boy is nine years old , perfectly normal until the age six , and then he started twisting his body , first the right foot , then the left foot , then the right arm , then the left arm , then the trunk , and then by the time he arrived , within the course of one or two years of the disease onset , he could no longer walk , he could no longer stand . 
he was crippled , and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted , progressively disabled , and many of these children do not survive . 
the area of the brain for sadness is on red hot . 
so we wondered , can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat , can we turn down the activity , and what will be the consequence of that ? 
and we placed electrodes in area 25 , and in the top scan you see before the operation , area 25 , the sadness area is red hot , and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue , and then , after three months of continuous stimulation , 24 hours a day , or six months of continuous stimulation , we have a complete reversal of this . 
they shut down . they turn off . 
the lights are out in these areas of the brain . 
thank you very much . 
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies . 
so it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then . 
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table . 
so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions . 
and so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered . 
and so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where i work with people from different disciplines - - artists , technologists , scientists - - to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human - glacier relations . 
we want to see and measure storms - - brainstorms , that is . 
actually , the first time we recorded more than one neuron - - a hundred brain cells simultaneously - - we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal , this is the first image we got , the first 10 seconds of this recording . 
so we got a little snippet of a thought , and we could see it in front of us . 
we are doing a thousand now . 
everything that we ever do , everything that every human has ever done , do or will do , requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms . 
this is a brain . 
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this - - my brain , any brain . 
and what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies , these brain symphonies , and try to extract from them the messages they carry . 
and you have a scheme here that describes how it works . 
and if we can actually provide feedback , sensory signals that go back from this robotic , mechanical , computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain , back to the brain , how the brain deals with that , of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery . 
as you can see here , she likes to use a joystick , like any one of us , any of our kids , to play this game . 
so every trajectory that you see of the cursor now , this is the exact first moment she got that . 
well , she did that because she , at that time , had acquired a new arm . 
just fast forward 10 years . 
the brain is assimilating that too , as fast as we can measure . 
so where are we taking all this ? 
well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world . 
so our idea is to create a bypass , is to use these brain - machine interfaces to read these signals , larger - scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again , bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body , a whole body called an exoskeleton , a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients . 
this same mechanism , we hope , will allow these patients , not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body , but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls . 
the napalm is burning there quite nicely . 
so this is what happens as that burn gets going . 
i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday , because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again . 
it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous . 
if it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill . 
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water . 
it spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it . 
it is green . it is a shrine to greenishness . 
and we get kind of in on our own con . 
i mean - - and this is funny , it looks funny here . 
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states . 
this is an early - on photograph - - you can see , we had these gushers . 
okay , so that guy is actually still with us . 
you have these pictures of birds . 
everything that we are really stemmed from this period . 
we were very reactive , as opposed to being proactive about what happened . 
and so what we did was , actually , we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling . 
as you can see , our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out . 
we put it in . there was a tremendous banditry problem . 
now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car . 
what are the laws ? what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ? 
one thing is - - we need to stay away from the theater . 
it comes in on the side - - the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un - useful stuff , which is called the rejected energy - - the waste , goes up to the top . 
we have policies that reward sprawl - - we have all kinds of policies . 
let me give you a little sense of how this would work . 
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there . 
so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics . 
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma . 
you just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out . 
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid . 
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience . 
there is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world , on the street , that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with , and that is that all of us want to be happy . 
now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while . 
learning patience , for instance . 
so how can we find a method that will harness this ? 
you open your ears . you open your nose . 
you open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us . 
and then we can also open our hearts , our hearts for the opportunities , for the opportunities also to help others , to make others happy , because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy . 
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony . 
your ears are always on - - you have no ear lids . 
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters . 
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening . 
here are two of them . 
men typically listen reductively . 
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time . 
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler . 
we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this . 
and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed . 
there is a cost of compression . 
i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art . 
i do urge you to explore this . 
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions . 
and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved . 
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely . 
my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction . 
but before i do that , i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics , which require huge amounts of energy to create and , because of their disposal issues , are slowly poisoning our planet . 
this is a material you all know is styrofoam , but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff . 
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops . 
today , we use a single feedstock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you . 
we should be talking about half , a quarter , one - tenth the energy content . 
i fit into it , you fit into it , and a hundred years tops , my body can return to the earth with no preprocessing . 
yet that packaging i got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years . 
this is crazy . 
but nature provides us with a really good model here . 
and this gets us back to the mushrooms . 
and by using mycelium as a glue , you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry , and you can create materials with many different properties , materials that are insulating , fire - resistant , moisture - resistant , vapor - resistant - - materials that can absorb impacts , that can absorb acoustical impacts . 
the next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool , physically filling an enclosure , a mold , in whatever shape you want to get . 
our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production . 
we then process these husks with some basic equipment . 
so in front of your eyes , this part just self - assembled . 
they used to use a plastic packaging buffer , but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material . 
the next is self - assembly , because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process . 
and i think that can be some really good news . 
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china , it has , you know , led to considerable angst amongst the western populations . 
interestingly , what he finds is — and by the way , the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations : how many times does a future patent reference the older patent ? — he finds something very interesting . 
the second kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies , where many companies today are contracting indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world . 
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms . 
what the global delivery model allows is , it allows you to take previously geographically core - located tasks , break them up into parts , send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists , and then specify the means for reintegrating them . 
so , if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs , at some stage , the next step of the ladder has to follow . 
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives , where these people have enough access to education and health care , so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear . 
the children were killed on the spot . 
and they were able to get tens of thousands of , primarily , women , some men , in the streets to bring about change . 
we had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process , and people came out from all over the city , including areas that were stable neighborhoods , as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy . 
and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things . 
so they , too , could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided . 
and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do . 
i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe . 
and where in the world would you find such water ? 
they work on a shoestring budget . 
the fabric alone weighs two tons . 
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub - zero temperatures . 
one is exploring the cosmos on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being . 
alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice . 
and you can imagine what that would be like , right , in your own life - - and i know this is true of some of you - - if you were drinking all day , and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life , you would have better ideas . 
it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds , different fields of expertise , and share . 
this was their conjugal bed , in a sense - - ideas would get together there . 
and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story . 
what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation , unusual levels of creativity ? 
they decided to tackle this really pressing problem of , you know , the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world . 
and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries , and then it ends up being useless . 
they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working . 
and this is what they ended up coming with . 
i mean , this is one vision of it . 
this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , unpredictable collisions - - people from different backgrounds . 
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually - - when you research this field - - people are notoriously unreliable , when they actually kind of self - report on where they have their own good ideas , or their history of their best ideas . 
they happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting , when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings , oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having , the error , the noise in the signal they were discovering . 
and now , i guarantee you certainly half of this room , if not more , has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space . 
and i bet you one of you , if not more , has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last - - in the last day or last week , right ? 
and that , i think , is a great case study , a great lesson in the power , the marvelous , kind of unplanned emergent , unpredictable power of open innovative systems . 
chance favors the connected mind . 
thank you very much . 
but i would say no . 
in this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc . 
and we even have to be asked sometimes , very kindly , to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons . 
then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent . 
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean . 
well we have a whole o . r . team , general anesthesia , nurses , and another doctor across from me . 
and there is probably a better way to do this . 
we can do multiple passes through that same entry . 
no robots required . 
this was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient . 
it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live - saving bone marrow donors . 
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber - illusionist . 
texting has a 100 percent open rate . 
now the parents are really alarmed . 
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things - - charting the future essentially . 
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen . 
now in hindsight , it was actually good for some things , like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid , but at the time this was really doomsday . 
the shake developed out of , really , a single - minded pursuit of pointillism , just years of making tiny , tiny dots . 
and eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles , because of the shake . 
the same thing the next day , and then the next , quickly slipping into a creative slump . 
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands . 
embrace the shake . 
what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation , as each time i created , the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project . 
it did not happen overnight . 
and the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging , non - verbal feedback like this . 
go ! 
it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage . 
how would that extend to advice , like , if someone is making a lifestyle choice between , say , a stressful job and a non - stressful job , does it matter which way they go ? 
every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs . 
that what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse . 
what costs us 10 pounds in a different context we may actually welcome . 
but this does not apply the other way around . 
on the other hand , change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management , so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company , it goes to charity , and the mental willingness to pay completely changes . 
if that seems like some strange , abstruse thing , in the u . k . , the post office had a 98 percent success rate at delivering first - class mail the next day . 
then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink . 
from her , i learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson - - that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls . 
in retrospect , i think she was slightly worried about my sanity . 
in our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy . 
i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there . 
everywhere i went , i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me . 
one is interested in sweeping generalizations . 
the other , in nuances . 
one draws boundaries . 
the other recognizes no frontiers . 
identity politics is made of solid bricks . 
books have saved the introverted , timid child that i was - - that i once was . 
like that , my fiction as well . 
which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable , vivid journey in translation . 
so no ego problems . 
anyway , as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was , it was that second part , being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining , where the futility of my quest really set in . 
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon - to - be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect . 
it takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world . 
his intent is to be funny . 
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight - or - fight responses , operate . 
have at it you radical bastards . the field is yours . 
economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy . 
first there were drums and then knock - knock jokes . 
how about that ? how about we create a better world for nothing ? 
that is a lot of punch for 14 words . 
boy : no , you play mom and i play dad . 
girl : women ! one word and they get upset . 
it is where a third of all the traffic is going . 
and i ended up on top . 
i ended up at this really fancy party . 
and saying whatever you like , i think , is powerful . 
doing whatever you like is now crossing a line . 
but words , saying things , you know , can be constructive ; it can be really damaging . 
99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out . 
okay , well . 
lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime . 
these are both real objects . 
one goes extinct for the other to survive . 
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas . 
so the gains from trade are only going to grow . 
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by . 
you find a sheep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it . 
the stone axe was made by someone for himself . 
so when did this habit start ? 
their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today . 
it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men . 
in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30 , 000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more - - but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away . 
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4 , 000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had . 
i mean this quite seriously . 
and yet despite this , hardly any of us have ever heard space . 
but like any long length of charged wire , it also inadvertently became an antenna . 
he had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them . 
but it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades . 
well , commercial hunting happened . 
these birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton , and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground , they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands . 
by the end of the century , there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers . 
it was hunted to death for its feathers . 
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen . 
it was loved . they tried to protect it . it died anyway . 
de - extinction falls in that category . 
he showed how all of this can be put together . 
so what do you do about that ? 
everybody thought is was finished . 
there were just 254 left . 
what are they concerned about ? 
so even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain , by the time the structure has been folded , its physical location is very different between individuals , even identical twins . 
there is no longer any consistency in the surface signals . 
so : one , two , three , go . 
same sort of drill . so : one , two , three , go . 
good job . good job . 
now blink right to go right . 
now blink left to turn back left . 
so it evolved . 
now there are 192 . 
but i think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions . 
40 billion of these things built . 
the most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that . 
the light bulb was a fairly simple task , from their standpoint . 
home electronics . 
by the way , i do make it look a little bit easier than it is . 
most of the time it looked like this . 
the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone . 
this is as messy as it gets . 
are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? and so forth . 
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual . 
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spatial operating environment , we call it . 
you have to be able to navigate in 3d . 
and we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest . 
so this is the inevitability about it . 
i wanted to be a biker chick . 
because they were all about being free , the wind in your hair - - just to be free . 
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun . 
i am , and have been since birth , legally blind . 
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ? 
hey . 
no limitations . 
but very quickly i recovered . it was like that . 
and you know , disabled people are hugely educated . 
and temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped . 
but all that belief had fueled me so long . 
can i tell you , airports are a disaster . 
oh , for the love of god . 
god no , it was therapy . 
hardly appropriate at this moment in time . 
and i had no idea where i was going . i had no idea . 
and there i was crying away , and smash , bash on my rock . 
six thousand people got to see because of that . 
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible . 
and stop with the labels , the limiting . 
so i imagine my life : if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal , and they found it , and , in fact , they found lots of it right here . 
and back here in the united states , we saw economic despair , deprivation . 
and just imagine what you would feel . 
somebody else has a design for it . 
when oil was at stake , somehow , suddenly , things mattered . 
they worship the christian god , they have crosses , they carry bibles . 
and their leaders , their leaders : before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country - - and you know the reason - - before they send them off , they go to a christian church , and they pray to their christian god , and they ask for protection and guidance from that god . 
and you feel something about that - - of course you do . 
you pass it around . you pass his words around . 
this is frightening . 
these christians , who are these christians ? 
these christians are nuts . 
and this is a perspective . 
now here comes the radical experiment . 
okay , try this . bring it back . 
can you feel the rage ? 
can you go there ? 
which one ? 
can you imagine saying that ? 
can you go there ? 
attend to other lives , other visions . 
even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework , for instance . 
you house is in a terrible state . 
your partner is about to return . 
even on my journey up here - - the joy that i have on my journey up here every single time . 
the 404 page is that . 
you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey . 
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator , and we had eight startups sitting around there . 
so over time , time and space have compressed because of this . 
and then , once you do that , you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way , instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in - - and oh , i have to do this , and i have to do this , and i have to do this . 
how could this have gone by like lightning ? 
as a matter of fact , this picture is supposed to be me during training . 
and i put together an expedition . 
the navigation is difficult . 
and there are all kinds of problems . 
no stone left unturned . 
and i was on fire - - excruciating , excruciating pain . 
and the next thing is paralysis . 
the box jelly again - - all across the neck , all across here . 
and i got back in . 
a lot of athletes have this , you know , sort of invincibility . 
and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50 - ft . tentacles . 
and they do this wrapping . 
and so , what after that ? 
live it large . live it large . 
and i just ate it up . 
i drew , and i drew , and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family , i could draw , do what i wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak - - i was very shy - - and i could still get approval . 
i was launched as a cartoonist . 
it takes what we know , and it twists it . 
and then also my family was in chaos , and i drew to try to bring my family together - - - - try to bring my family together with laughter . 
consequently , we have . 
we have amazing antennae . 
but i feel blessed to be able to work with them . 
and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected , that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all , and maybe engage them to make a difference . 
i then had a bit of a wake - up call when i was 14 . 
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy . 
it was also a pretty good year for this guy . 
how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ? 
we could have been done by lunch here . 
so here i was . 
just absolutely amazing , every single dive . 
cephalopods - - head - foots . as a kid i knew them as calamari , mostly . 
tough thing to do . 
disappears right into the background . 
watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture . 
and these are made of this kind of tube - - electricity tube , we call it in holland . 
and that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way . 
can i have the feeler here ? 
it gets way better . 
before we think about where we go from here . 
so clearly , apocalyptically - minded authors have overstated the case . 
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error . 
okay . 
first of all , recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration , whereas if we thought we were already there , there would be no particular point to pushing harder . 
give it up for that . 
how about that ? 
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work - - i would hope , at least . 
you almost never hear someone say the office . 
i did these conference calls . i did all this stuff . 
at the office , most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary . 
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ? 
so i have some suggestions to remedy the situation . 
another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face - to - face stuff , tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products - - things like that . 
and there are very , very few things that are that urgent that need to happen , that need to be answered right this second . 
and i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done . 
i then , in the last few years , learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre . 
and my intention was to go out to the gyre , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities . 
all of my beverages are packaged in plastic , even at the health food market . 
and if you really look into it , particularly when it comes to plastic bottles , most of it is only down - cycled , or incinerated , or shipped to china . 
alternatives exist ; some of them are very old - school . 
so whenever possible , to choose alternatives to single - use plastics . 
25 percent of her grade is based on english . 
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ? 
so it needed a very articulate front paw . 
so we made a model . 
move around . come on . 
i figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750 , 000 . 
now , there was one small catch . 
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward . 
i am totally down with splitting the bill . 
so needless to say , i was not having a good night . 
so i run home , i call my mother , i call my sister , and as i do , at the end of each one of these terrible , terrible dates , i regale them with the details . 
there were just bad for me . 
what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate ? 
i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points , and i ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 , and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart , who would challenge and stimulate me , and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points . 
i figured there would be a minimum of 700 points before i would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message . 
well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well . 
and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile . 
all of the women who were popular showed some skin . 
it was enough for a date . 
it looks like you did come up with a really , really great system . 
now , your matzoh balls . 
and the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels . 
now you probably know the answer to this already . 
one of the most early work was done in automotive design - - some very exciting work was done there . 
remember that ? 
so i started to ask myself questions about it . 
you see , using this bit , the thinky bit , the slow bit of the brain - - using that . 
and would you do me a favor ? 
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ? 
i felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation . 
they arrive first . 
would you mind taking the brain out , and i just want you to feel something . 
so pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in . 
poignancy is a word i love as a designer . 
and this is the dilemma , this is the paradox , of beauty . 
layer after layer of legend , sport , details that resonate . 
i mean , if i just go through some of them now - - i know about laminar flow when it comes to air - piercing objects , and that does it consummately well , you can see it can . 
and so look at her . 
beautiful ? maybe lesser . 
so all hail to that . 
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one . 
and finally , the layer that i love , of knowledge . 
only sometimes . only sometimes . 
look at this , mom ! i made it ! 
i got way too much time on my hands . 
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice . 
all right boys , take it away . 
i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are . 
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing . 
it wants to be chanted out loud , to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue . 
but all is not lost in translation . 
the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own . 
as in , for instance , that little matter of virgins and paradise . 
old - fashioned orientalism comes into play here . 
not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight . 
and as i looked into his eyes , i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written for political prisoners , that i would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12 - year - old boy who had done something important for anybody . 
the second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel . 
and we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law . 
and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws . 
the key that we see , though , is training and then early access . 
and i believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool . 
so he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . and he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit . 
thank you . 
so , a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant , world - class neuropsychologist : i had a baby . 
water wings - - an inch of water . 
and , despite being cursed with my athletic inability , he plays soccer . 
close . 
seventy - two . 
how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play , cleared for return to play , applies to them ? 
so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am , how do i get any sleep at all ? 
how can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids ? 
if only . 
the first : study up . 
it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy - in ; it lacked stakeholder traction . 
speak up also with coaching staff . 
ask about what kind of protective equipment is available . 
how old it is ? 
maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear - - which brings us to suit up . 
he was told that a cure did not exist . 
this is fairly recent science that has shown that . 
so what india did is no longer possible . 
this is what you see today , and this is in developing countries , so what that means is , unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now , we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis , because new drugs are developed , new drugs go to market , but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries . 
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool . the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents . 
now we count on the willingness of drug companies to make that happen . we count on those companies that understand that it is in the interest , not only in the interest of the global good , but also in their own interest , to move from conflict to collaboration , and through the medicines patent pool they can make that happen . 
and that is that the planet earth , or the solar system , or our environment or whatever , is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution - - or creation , as it used to be thought - - and our present existence , and most important , our future survival . 
and especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other . 
so can we have the lights back on please ? thank you . 
that physical objects , as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time . 
and then thirdly , less tangible , but just as essential for the open - ended creation of knowledge , of explanations , is evidence . 
now , our environment is inundated with evidence . 
so in fact , intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open - ended creation of knowledge . any such cube , anywhere in the universe , could become the same kind of hub that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there . 
and if we want to be the exception to that , then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species , and our civilization , from all the others - - namely , our special relationship with the laws of physics , our ability to create new explanations , new knowledge - - to be a hub of existence . 
hence , we need a stance of problem - fixing , not just problem - avoidance . 
at the moment , these things are fringe research . 
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right - - not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely - - is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival . 
contestants also put themselves forward . 
it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value . 
no small thing . 
we only can create a vision of the future , how it might be , a vision which reveals disruptive ideas , which is inspiring , and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking . 
parents would shuffle kids away from us . 
and back in the early 20th century , the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day . 
the first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators . 
the next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards . 
we all sit at various places at various times on this scale , but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass - market success or mass - market acceptance of an idea , you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration , and then the system tips . 
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope . 
and people had hope , yes , but until they realized their situation worsens every day - - either because they are being killed or because , somehow , they are poorer than eight years ago . 
so , doctors prescribe medication . 
and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads . 
traumatized people also easily lose control - - symptoms are hyper - arousal and memory flashbacks - - so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly , suddenly , and they cannot control it . 
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably - - mostly the family - - and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context . 
and 70 percent regained their lives . 
so , from 2008 up until today , a substantial change and step forward has been taking place . 
this means , certainly , to retrain all health staff . 
they go to the clinics , because they want to cure their immediate symptoms , and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions , develop their resources , learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future . 
so i believe this kept me running . 
i thought it was an idea worth spreading , and i think it must be , can be , could be replicated elsewhere . 
maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations . 
so now , just , this is an abrupt transition here . 
there was three years where i actually did have a real job , sort of . 
right ? like , seriously , nobody would do this . 
and originally it was a math problem more or less . 
what goes in is what we are . 
schools are underfunded . 
we need 40 - minute lunches - - most schools have 20 - minute lunches - - and lunches that are time - appropriate . 
now as you may know , sound travels in waves , so if you have a speaker , a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal , transform it into a vibration , which is then transported through the air , is captured by our ear , and transformed into an audio signal again . 
so we had this speaker set up , and we had the camera facing it , and lots of lights pointing at the speaker , and i would set up the speaker , put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker , and we would do this over and over again , and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker . 
ah , some of you have . excellent . 
is it just some strange materials ? 
and these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification , introducing abstractions that we try to make logically consistent , and also taking the hypothetical seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is . 
were our immediate ancestors on the verge of mental retardation ? 
or are we on the verge of all being gifted ? 
how could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ? 
now you see again , this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience , and it was important to that person what color bears were - - that is , they had to hunt bears . 
none of these problems are real . 
well , the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees may have been morally remiss , but they were cognitively very agile . 
i merely have a holiday in psychology , and what interests me in general is moral debate . 
you state them as abstractions and you use logic on them . 
calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy : there are six sides to a die , two sides to a coin , 52 cards in a deck . 
it was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember pigs . and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on leashes are more probable . 
compare these to the actual numbers . 
nine of them have been sold to these individuals . 
it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and , if you win , you get 20 bucks . is this a good bet ? 
would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ? 
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ? 
what the hell difference should it make ? 
this problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions . 
most people say they would . 
would you drive to get it ? at this point , 0 . 003 savings - - the 100 dollars . 
compared to your regular friends , they are boring and dull , right ? because in this new context , the comparison is very , very different . in fact , you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship . 
you go to the stereo store , you see two sets of speakers - - these big , boxy , monoliths , and these little , sleek speakers , and you play them , and you go , you know , i do hear a difference : the big ones sound a little better . 
well , by and large people are enormously impatient . 
now , why in the world do you get this pattern of results ? 
they were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups , rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves , had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today . 
that was remarkable . 
talk more about it . 
i mean , this is a society that has learned - - and there are others too - - that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it , shall i say , as those of us who have not had many terror attacks . 
people died ; so be it . 
but certainly i see your point : that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning . 
we collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder . 
where a country is is a sort of average score on these things . 
highly significant relationship . 
same thing is going on . 
but most of it is about more punitive sentencing , harsher sentencing . 
think of the expense , the human cost of that . 
one is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , whatever the outcome , seem to be the more unequal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan . 
it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax . 
it has a smaller welfare state . 
otherwise that would introduce bias . 
and of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on . 
what about causality ? 
and indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes . 
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on . 
on top of this , when you get so many animals so close together , it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse . 
growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat . 
if we can succeed here , it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon . 
this is actually only about 1 . 5 percent of what the final display will be in may . 
so , take a look . 
and then , as the other axis kicks in , those actually blur into a volume . 
consider a few stats for a moment . 
and it was incredible . 
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future ? 
it was absolutely revolting . 
it made me sick to my stomach . 
and they were equally if not more horrifying - - the images were . 
be careful ! 
i am the headmaster for all parts . 
that is an incredible wish . 
we applaud the well - mannered box . 
if you think of the great buildings , of the cathedrals , of the temples , of the pyramids , of pagodas , of cities in india and beyond , you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea , but by people . 
so the unexpected is always unexpected . 
so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability , but an architecture that is full of tension , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart , and that breaks out of the shackles of habits . 
and yet , i do believe that in every social space , in every public space , there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought , that blunt technique , but something that pinpoints , and can point in various directions forward , backward , sideways and around . 
so that is indeed what is memory . 
it can reach into sources that are not explicitly available . 
and that indeed is the architectural mission that i believe is important , is to create spaces that are vibrant , that are pluralistic , that can transform the most prosaic activities , and raise them to a completely different expectation . 
risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws , into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready - made thing . 
and now , a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent 20 , 000 hours online and an additional 10 , 000 hours playing video games - - a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined . 
all of us are engaged in a seismic , fundamental realignment of culture and communications , a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry , the magazine industry , the book and publishing industry and more . 
saddled in the performing arts as we are , by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming , locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues , where we charge exorbitant prices . 
especially now , as we all must confront the fallacy of a market - only orientation , uninformed by social conscience ; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters , and especially characters of the young people , who all too often , are subjected to bombardment of sensation , rather than digested experience . 
thank you , and godspeed . 
it did mine . 
so i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings - - the shape of the wing , the shape of the fuselage and so on - - and build an airplane over these drawings that i knew followed some of the principles of flying . 
so i chose furniture . 
so i started doing that . 
so the discipline was - - as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air , for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body , and what the body needs , wants , indicates it needs . 
i basically engineered it . 
i built it . 
and i flew it . 
and the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office , at the work place - - people who worked , and used task seating , a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long . 
now that may not mean a lot to some of you . 
he came over and looked at it . 
and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own . 
just your own . 
just relieving your arms with armrests takes 20 percent of that load off . 
now that , if your spine is not held in a good position , will help bend your spine the wrong way , and so on . 
so here we are . 
ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area , right there . 
you cant hit your elbow on bottom . 
and yet , many of these get built . 
because what you can measure in virtuality is everything . 
and by this , i mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate , the nature , the type , the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort . 
go and get a certain amount of a certain little game - y item . 
it keeps people engaged . 
you find that - - you know , between five and 20 is about the right number for keeping people going . 
and everything comes towards that , and they watch it creeping up , and they own that as it goes along . 
it all feeds in as minute reinforcement . 
this is absolutely crucial , and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this . 
but if you can model things for people , if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes , then they can learn a lesson , they can see , they can move on , they can understand . 
and fifth , the element of uncertainty . 
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up . 
and i just look at this , and i think , yes , we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets , by using elements of uncertainty , by using these multiple targets , by using a grand , underlying reward and incentive system , by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups , in terms of streets to collaborate and compete , to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see . 
but again , those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal , to take the data , to take the observations , of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement . 
so hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions . 
but then , for some reason , i got into something else , just recently . 
and so this would be the typical talk i would give . 
and what came up was a number of pieces of data . 
and how you end up with a psychopath , and a killer , depends on exactly when the damage occurs . 
you get different kinds of psychopaths . 
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too . 
and in fact this is probably why mostly men , boys , are psychopathic killers , or are very aggressive . 
and what i think might happen in these areas of the world , where we have constant violence , you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence . 
and now the boys and the girls get them . 
so i think after several generations , and here is the idea , we really have a tinderbox . 
and the first murder of a mother by a son was my great - great - great - great - great - great - grandfather . 
but more likely is this . 
but our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here . 
and now they are close as can be . 
so we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline . 
the white line is for the u . k . , and then the u . s . 
negative . 
this led to a fantasy . 
what if i try to fit a curved line to this historical record ? 
i can make the curved line end anywhere i wanted , but i decided i would end it at 0 . 2 , just like the u . k . growth for the first four centuries . 
all the rest went to the top one percent . 
are we going to grow at 0 . 8 ? 
they created pollution , they created odors , they were hard to control , the light was dim , and they were a fire hazard . 
then they had to bring them in . 
urban environments make people more productive than on the farm . 
so here we are back to the horse and buggy . 
your challenge is , can you match what we achieved ? 
it takes guts to stand out like that . 
the first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader . 
and here comes a second follower . 
now god , angered at this attempt to usurp his power , destroyed the tower , and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt , he scattered the people by giving them different languages - - confused them by giving them different languages . 
we can build on their wisdom . 
and the reason that dilemma arose is , it turns out , that social learning is visual theft . 
if i can watch which lure you use to catch a fish , or i can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better , or if i follow you secretly to your mushroom patch , i can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills , and maybe even catch that fish before you do . 
and so it seems that we use our language , not just to cooperate , but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities , and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside . 
and we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures , we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups . 
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 253 translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities . 
and what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange , and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity , his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea that our destiny is to be one world with one language . 
or when you drink a little too much at a party , just out of anxiety . 
or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt , or whatever . 
it will be something that we talk about in 100 years . 
and knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes , we continue to allow our children , our sons and daughters , to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking . 
our cultural joy , our national joy is nowhere to be seen . 
that , to me , is the big question that we face as a people right now : how do we change ? how do we change as a culture , and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of , and that is our own behavior ? 
do you worry about what is going to kill you ? 
we still have one foot in the dark ages . 
that means that us terrestrials occupy a minority . 
also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights . 
they live in a three - dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way , that way , that way or that way . 
ok , this is good stuff . 
she has twice the wingspan that i do . 
it was the fact she was going so slow . 
it just seems wrong to try and patent - - - - the freedom for underwater flight . 
but the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body . 
they are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything . 
i work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation . 
99 . 9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution . 
and therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation . 
she is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder . 
and therefore they could fight in a male - dominated world , very easily , and not feel very shy about it . 
what has been my challenge ? 
and there is a long pause . 
can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ? 
this is an extremely strange fact . 
but nevertheless , the system has moved in a more liberal direction , moved in a more democratic direction . 
a little - known fact about india in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms , the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self - rule , privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts . 
in fact , if you compare india with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth - - now india is growing between eight and nine percent - - even before this period , india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies . 
it has the improving fundamentals . 
and i hold in my hand a tissue - mimicking phantom . 
you see the phantom within the aquarium . 
you know all about imaging , right , ultrasound imaging . 
and the physician will then take a regular mr scan . 
you see the transducer , the light blue . 
this is really a unique capability of the mr . 
this is an immediate relief . 
he rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly . 
is very painful . 
there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by mr , because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy - - treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland , and by that , avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence . 
the challenge there with a breathing and awake patient - - and in all our treatments , the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician - - is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time . 
one is , think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery , and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large - - and i think also from their physicians , by the way . 
is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ? 
okay , that was kind of cool . 
makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there . 
and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently . 
how much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets ? 
this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment . 
it looks harmless enough . 
it does this in a couple of ways - - chasing productivity , which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff . 
status - driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty . 
and here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic - - the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together to drive an engine of growth . 
and this engine is not just economic value ; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system , driven by our own insatiable appetites , driven in fact by a sense of anxiety . 
this is what it looks like , essentially , this credit and debt system , just for the u . k . 
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view . 
and i had finally got around to doing some draft stripping , installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts . 
so we can do that here - - we can just put in a little search term . 
and if someone could convince you that we actually can make the - - what was it ? - - the 130 - fold improvement in efficiency , of reduction of carbon footprint , would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge - based goods ? 
they belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents , and girls would be dolled up to get married . 
my family , in my city , and almost in the country , was unique . 
we were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys . 
and my parents were part of a landed property family . 
so this is the foundation time which i got . 
so we are four of us in four corners of the world . 
but that response comes out of those 90 points . 
this is what comes next . 
how do i prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10 ? 
this is about tough policing , equal policing . 
so i was sent to all indiscriminate postings , postings which others would say no . 
here i got a prison assignment . 
this was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals . 
obviously , it was . 
stationery was donated . 
secondly , this concept . 
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analog models of control and command . 
they have collated crowd - sourced data and rendered the invisible visible . 
but we can also pull up , using speech - to - text translation , we can pull the entire transcript , and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself . 
and a few rise to the surface . 
momentum was being built . 
and this gets shown in art galleries like this , as a sequence . 
and the camera can lie , and it makes it very , very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths . 
so , i continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter . 
and at the same time , it removes us from the real subject matter , and this acts as a sort of titillating thing . 
all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist . the press were writing about this , giving full pages about how terrible this was . 
so , these are broadsheets , tabloids , debates were being had all about this work , films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work , politicians were getting involved - - all sorts of things - - great headlines . 
this is the look - alike , so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous . 
stills from the tv series went into this book . 
so i made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same . 
it was a bit of a road stopper , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds , but huge fun - - it was great for me to do a performance . 
also , people were taking photographs of this , so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly , all this imagery . 
and also , commenting on the behind the scenes - - well , as we know now - - what goes on in prisons . 
and sometimes asking the real celebrity , mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person , which is highly embarrassing . . 
and then , i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now . 
i guess , you know , he was the big hero . 
so i had , you know , a hero at a distance . 
but just ask what the molecule - - how should it fold up ? 
they said it was lousy , and it was . 
so in a sense , it is a sort of digital - type information . 
most scientists are really rather dull . 
and we use their technique . 
we saw one autistic kid , about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes . 
so this same technique should probably look at all . 
and yet , in the controls there were three . 
and teachers are also frustrated . 
but in education it looks very different - - dumbed - down problems , lots of calculating , mostly by hand . 
and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world , beyond virtually any other part of doing math . 
instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four - - conceptualizing problems , applying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that . 
so what are the issues people bring up with this ? 
this is just nuts . 
you can make it a quartic equation . make it kind of harder , calculating - wise . 
same principles applied - - calculations , harder . 
and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this . 
well , another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding . 
so one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams . 
but what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins , into which we , like molecular locksmiths , can fashion an active , small , organic molecule or drug substance . 
well that would be impossible and , rightly , illegal to do in humans . 
what we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent , motivated , enthusiastic , hopefully well - funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide . 
and so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles : that of opensource and that of crowdsourcing to quickly , responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer . 
well what kind of explanation could we have for this ? 
so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains . 
and they were a lot of fun . 
this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had . 
in some it is hot . 
so that was just a little snip . 
this is an unusual installation of airport seating . 
so those are cool images . but these are ones i think are really cool . 
you try things out . 
so here is the tiny creature . 
lower right is a solar do - nothing toy . 
ed : okay , good . 
and then things get to be a little questionable . 
i really thank you for your time . 
let me first address a few popular misconceptions . 
as cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates , the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three - dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end - on - end to form chains . 
and then this bubbling , this membrane bubbling , is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell . 
the expected five year survival is less than five percent . 
the first group received second - line chemotherapy , which is expected to double the life expectancy , versus no treatment at all . 
he received the standard treatments . 
he received high dose radiation to the head . 
this is a therapy that takes time to work . 
is pull down on those toggles to flare , slow himself down just a little bit , and then come in for a nice landing . 
what is it & # 91 ; like & # 93 ; to be up there ? 
you take a position like that . 
you are just in the element . 
there is no handle , no steering nothing ? 
yr : actually , i try to stay just fit . 
just , i try to keep my mobility through new activities . 
describe for me the equipment since you have it here . 
yr : yeah , two - meter span . 
yr : yeah . i did try in & # 91 ; the & # 93 ; clouds , but you lose & # 91 ; orientation completely & # 93 ; . 
so i did try to take , again , a climb altitude . 
but most probably i did something like that . 
something that is not very safe in image . 
civil aviation is something that we know very well . 
yr : it was down on the bottom . 
this is coming from the heart of finance . 
you get the idea . 
what should you take home from all of this ? 
this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war , and nameless refugees , whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes , dirty face , scared eyes . 
we have only been discussing and consumed with high - level preoccupations over troop levels , drawdown timelines , surges and sting operations , when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn , where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going . 
this is the language of sterility . 
you learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership . 
there is a side that leads the front - line discussion , and there is a side that leads the back - line discussion . 
i find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping , and the group of people who are mostly - - though not exclusively - - who are keeping life going in the midst of war , are not included in the negotiating table . 
if we just reverse that distribution of funds , perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world . 
buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems . 
we looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated , which are the data points in the blue . 
we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated , where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable , but they made them operable for our study . 
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health . 
it has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth , our spit . 
so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another . 
why does this matter ? 
and this model may not necessarily be the best for our health . 
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside . 
we all need people who will give us feedback . 
i think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan , things you cannot convey in a standard , things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy . 
this is me . 
and i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him ; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo . 
and he never expected this . 
and just these little things . 
and she was writing one day , and , you know , then she disappeared for a little bit . 
so , thank you . 
but whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else , we give it a whole network of analogies too . 
sexually unattractive people leave us cold . 
so she took me along to translate . 
and she told this woman . 
dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you . 
i was a wimp . 
there were some really bad people there . 
he was obsessed . 
this is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web . 
so , the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves . 
so , it went from about five percent , which was when this meme started , to 70 percent at the end of voting . 
the next highest name pulled in three . okay ? 
so , there was a clear lesson here . 
you have to get away from verbal language . 
i do lots and lots of flying , and if i was at the faa , what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of ? 
and what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here , in the really brilliant mind , and we lose a few social circuits here . 
that was like , we considered that super cool . 
how many cattle got poked with the prodder ? 
but did the regime learn anything ? not really . 
they were actually attacking them . 
and i went out . 
people were so empowered . 
it was amazing how everyone was so empowered and now asking for their rights . 
these are not election returns ; these are the percentage of people who are overweight . 
so , and you get all the disease - protective substances . 
and this really got me excited because again , we found the same pattern : the more people change , the more it affected the growth of their tumors . 
friendship , altruism , compassion , service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures - - once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self - interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease . 
and it was that compassion which bothered them , because when he saw - - in fact , he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car - - he drives his own car by the way - - and he saw in the rain , a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant . 
and incredible car . 
broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time . 
it was an open innovation , ideas from all over were welcome . 
but the current entry - level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less , but 21 percent more inside space . 
it had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system , a quick molding and modular components , enabling custom - made , on - the - spot limb fitments . 
you could feel it actually in an hour , by the way , whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day , as so on . 
can we do it & # 91 ; for & # 93 ; 100 dollars ? 
the indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge , however , scientifically validating it and making that journey from men to mice to men , not molecule to mice to men , you know . 
and you can see this indian psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; by doing things differently . 
so the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people , not only the current generation , but the future generations . 
the 21st century gift , which is very , very important for the whole world , whether it is global economic meltdown , whether it is climate change - - any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more - - not only the current generations , for the future generations . 
was there a vision you had ? what is it that drove you ? 
it was & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; high school . 
and one of them was & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; who taught us physics . 
he is splendidly attired in his 68 , 000 - dollar uniform , befitting the role of the french academy as legislating the correct usage in french and perpetuating the language . 
and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language - - the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary , it will already be well out of date . 
now , many events can be subject to either construal , kind of like the classic figure - ground reversal illusions , in which you can either pay attention to the particular object , in which case the space around it recedes from attention , or you can see the faces in the empty space , in which case the object recedes out of consciousness . 
you may just be loud or obnoxious , or some other way causing them to have the headache . 
an additional twist is that all of the constructions in english are used not only literally , but in a quasi - metaphorical way . 
and indeed , this kind of verbiage is not the exception , but the rule . 
and i think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts - - such as objects , space , time , causation and intention - - which are useful in a social , knowledge - intensive species , whose evolution you can well imagine , and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content - - space , time and force - - and apply them to new abstract domains , therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals , to conceptualize mathematics , physics , law and other abstract domains . 
now , mismatches - - when one person assumes one relationship type , and another assumes a different one - - can be awkward . 
and in a more subtle way , i think , this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability : the bribes , threats , propositions , solicitations and so on . 
nothing ventured , nothing gained . 
on the other hand , with indirect language , if you issue a veiled bribe , then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe , in which case you get the payoff of going free . 
more and more , the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance . 
. 
and across a whole range of fields - - from software , astronomy , natural sciences , vast areas of leisure and culture like kite - surfing , so on and so forth - - you find people who want to do things because they love it , but they want to do these things to very high standards . 
and it was huge - - it was absolutely enormous . 
meant to be a way to incentivize invention , meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge , they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place . 
and we allowed users , readers , two places where they could contribute to the paper : the letters page , where they could write a letter in , and we would condescend to them , cut it in half , and print it three days later . 
that costs about 100 dollars . 
so oil is playing a less significant role every year . 
and it has close to 1 , 200 such plants for 300 occupants . 
and the study showed that , compared to other buildings , there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent , respiratory systems by 34 percent , headaches by 24 percent , lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent . 
and also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air . 
so it causes a lot of inner conflict , you know , like part of me likes me , part of me hates me . 
these are dilemmas i have every day . 
i want to rob a bank in a film . i want to rob a bank in a film , but do it with a gun , with a gun , not with a bomb strapped around me , right . 
all it takes in one person to mess it up . 
now , i happened to be in times square that night doing a comedy show . 
my question is : why would you take credit for a failed car bombing ? 
and when you put your two year - old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide . 
but one of the things i try to do with my stand - up is to break stereotypes . 
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions - - institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc . 
i mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them . 
and somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father . 
but he actually talks to , has two - way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender . 
and now , obviously , they have it open . 
but what is really exceptional is the setting . 
three settings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clocked in , when you clocked in to an office , when you clocked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole duration of the time , there was no contact with your private sphere . 
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you . 
the phones were there . but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you . 
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage . 
and then the school enacts perfectly well . 
it mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices : rituals of entry , rituals of exit , the schedules , the uniforms in this country , things that identify you , team - building activities , be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time . 
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work . 
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere . 
so , until then , basically people were living on top of their trades . 
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere . 
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations . 
and they are doing it massively . 
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones . 
100 percent are using text . 
the point is that this re - appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions . 
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access . 
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated . 
and they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy . 
now as it turns out - - thank you . 
i used to be able to talk like that . 
there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again ; it just sort of became obvious . 
but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ? 
at first i was against it . 
the initials stood for programmed logic for automated teaching operations . 
excuse me . 
if i were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago , i would be as isolated as a hermit . 
a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer . 
and i ate the disliked ones first , because the ones you like , you want to save . 
energy , at the moment , is dominated by resource . 
if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers . 
but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world . 
but there is a catch . of course there is always a catch in these cases . 
and you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy . 
so , most of the time they repel . 
if you can get something to about 150 million degrees , things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration , this will happen , and it will release energy . 
there is one trickiness about this reaction . 
now , why the hell would we bother to do this ? 
this is basically why we would bother to do it . 
and we get within about the same price as current electricity . 
so , how would we make it ? 
it gets very expensive to do this research . 
seven nations are involved in building this . 
we have to get to this . 
so 2030 looks like an infinity away . 
when i was a little girl , my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day . 
there were no clouds in the sky . 
and so three days later , driving very fast , i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grapefruit - size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do . 
and then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming , the greens and the turquoise blues . 
my hair used to be straight . 
as i stand under them , i see not just a cloud , but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces , the same process in a small - scale version that helped to create our galaxy , our solar system , our sun and even this very planet . 
all of us here have great minds . 
and what i would like to maybe invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today , for two reasons . one : so that you can contribute more . and two : so that hopefully we can not just understand other people more , but maybe appreciate them more , and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face in our society today . 
and then you meet people that have been through ultimate pain - - psychologically , sexually , spiritually , emotionally abused - - and not always , but often , they become some of the people that contribute the most to society . 
now , when you ask people , you know , have you failed to achieve something ? 
thanks for the interaction on a high level there . 
the story people tell us is a bunch of different stories . 
bullshit . you like the surprises you want . 
like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there . total variety and uncertainty . 
how may know somebody like this ? come on . 
thank you . i hope this was of service . 
while creation sometimes seems a bit un - graspable , or even pointless , creativity is always meaningful . 
see , for instance , in this picture . 
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles . 
it was kind of a mixture of found object , product design and advertising . 
is a remnant of a race of - - a very evolved race of entertainers . 
the rocking podium . 
because clouds can mean anything you want . 
but i was still , you know - - this is a kitty cloud . 
and he did something that was very tricky . 
he put together two different media from different periods of time . 
first , he got an age - old way of making it , which was relief , and he worked this with three - point perspective , which was brand - new technology at the time . 
these always end up being a photograph at the end , or more like an etching in this case . 
i got some photographs from them . 
and by manipulating sugar over a black paper , i made portraits of them . 
and you have to walk very far to be able to see it . 
now i would do very small ones , which would be like - - but under the same light , and i would show them together , so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking . 
i was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there . 
my time is nearly up . 
and we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg , such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around , so that , as the blood flowed through our kidneys , it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies . 
suddenly , i saw a world that i had never seen before in the ocean - - schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface , coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful , large fish everywhere , manta rays . 
so i thought the scenes of never - ending wilderness would go on forever , but they did finally come to an end . 
what do we do with displaced fellow earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet ? 
and we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this very poor country to keep the area intact . 
many , many steps were taken to pull this off . 
he was 94 when this photograph was taken . 
and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories , of human - lived experiences filled with ex - slaves . 
so it seems right . 
the entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself . 
and you can see from these images , the site is so raw and almost archaeological . 
and of course the event itself is so recent , somewhere between history and current events , it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this , an event like this , to actually tell that story . 
and when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world - - this is obviously part of the landing gear - - we really started to understand that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself , between the way that people were telling the stories of the event , and how we ourselves needed to tell that story . 
this image in particular really captured our attention at the time , because it so much sums up that event . 
voice 17 : the twin towers . voice 18 : the twin towers . 
and so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity , of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself . 
and as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery , we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself . 
and as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about 9 / 11 , we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about 9 / 11 . 
so this is an image of the actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy , but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights , the two different towers , the first responders , and you can actually see within that different floors , and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections that were requested by the families themselves . 
and so when you go to the memorial , you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves . 
so suddenly what is this undifferentiated , anonymous group of names springs into reality as an individual life . 
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up . 
the price ? 
is there a waiting list ? 
every one of those statements is wrong . 
there was amazing improvements . 
refugee return , which the united nations high commission for refugees thought would be extremely unlikely , has largely happened . 
what we look for in firemen , in climbers , in policemen , and what we should look for in intervention , is intelligent risk takers - - not people who plunge blind off a cliff , not people who jump into a burning room , but who weigh their risks , weigh their responsibilities . 
and it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon . 
and about five years ago , we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the u . k . 
and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated . 
and all at no extra cost , no selection , and allowing the pupils the route into university , even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well . 
underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things , they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real - - all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does . 
and it spread because of the power of an idea - - so the very , very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal , things like working in teams , doing practical projects , and putting them right at the heart of learning , rather than on the edges . 
shall i ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations ? 
and it comes down to a couple of things . 
so allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth . 
but the actual sub - adult at 65 percent had no crest at all . 
so this is where people went astray again . 
so it is going to get bigger . 
going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ? 
are there any general conclusions that arise ? 
and i would expect that , if our human civilization carries on , then maybe in the next century people will be asking , why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ? 
and the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket , puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes - - right here , in his most vulnerable spot - - and he falls down either dead or unconscious , and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head , and the philistines see this and they turn and they just run . 
and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it , and they put a projectile , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the pouch , and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go , and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target . 
saul has the same expectation . 
goliath is not what he seems to be . 
so to begin with , the bible says that goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant . 
why does goliath not react to that ? 
of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with goliath , an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies . 
and acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision . 
with permission granted to record both before and after the operation , i set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings , because i wanted a really good baseline . 
this is a video prototype . 
so this is a very early prototype . 
and it would get exhausted , and it would collapse every time . 
well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement . 
and so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it - - almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something . 
he won by a margin . 
no offense . 
it grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half . 
but only around one - third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the english wikipedia , which is surprising to a lot of people . 
the media has covered this somewhat extensively . 
and no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities . 
so real - time peer review . 
and then users can set up their own personal watch list . 
which brings up a critical question : why is this time different , if it really is ? 
right ? great , hang up , flourish , go home . 
so the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward . 
with the benefit of hindsight , i now know the job was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer , but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bore me into some submission with what was going on around me . 
so we see some green shoots that things are getting better . 
so the green shoots are out there . 
we could send congress on an autonomous car road trip . 
and if we do enough of these kinds of things , the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different . 
and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other . 
it would be a big seller . 
it tells us what to imprint . 
and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us toward trying to understand . 
he wagged his tongue at the baby . 
the baby wagged her tongue back . 
twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships . 
they are what we call avoidantly attached . 
ninety - five percent of our professors report that they are above - average teachers . 
it seems so elementary . 
and now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are , comes this revolution in consciousness - - these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted , this new humanism . 
but what did he appeal to ? 
what else , after all , is there ? 
regulate , regulate , regulate . 
how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ? 
and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules , rules and incentives may make things better in the short run , but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run . 
and without intending it , by appealing to rules and incentives , we are engaging in a war on wisdom . 
some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed . 
they thought it would reduce their property values . 
well , acknowledge them . 
someone is always watching . 
now , you can see united states , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble . 
they had almost five percent infected , and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country , then . 
but focus now is back on prevention . 
war - torn congo is down there - - two , three , four percent . 
here it goes . 
so , what is it then ? 
but where are they situated ? 
it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency . 
but what we think is that it could be concurrency . 
and you collect a big number of exes . 
that part of the relationship went fine . 
indeed , it is discouraging . 
generally , about 85 percent of the people liked it . 
a hundred and nine voted it a 10 , the highest . ten voted it one . 
but look at the individual responses . 
this person rated it a two . 
how are you going to manage it ? 
now , we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles . 
but i feel that would be a huge loss , one i could live with , but still huge . 
cartoonists come in through the magazine every week . 
but they mostly are going to be rejected . 
many of them fade away . some of them stay . 
at a certain point , this rejection slip , in 1977 - - & # 91 ; we regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material . thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it . & # 93 ; — magically changed to this . 
and of course , that is not new yorker humor . 
what is new yorker humor ? 
here are some , generally you get my cast of cartoon mind . 
the new yorker and i , when we made comments , the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is . 
now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity . 
in each instance , our expectations are defied . 
what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude . 
there is no such thing as funny in and of itself . 
one way to look at it is this . 
if you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough , they will laugh at very , very little . 
better left undrawn . 
like , this cartoon would puzzle many people . 
but the way incongruity works is , observational humor is humor within the realm of reality . 
and the individual has 2 billion of these nano - size split ends . 
we know that you can grab onto things with them . 
and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance . 
and it was unstable without its tail . 
now mostly tails limit maneuverability , like this human inside this dinosaur suit . 
pretty powerful . 
if you make it slip a huge amount , this is what we discovered . 
if we could have the lights on it . 
it does an equilibrium glide . highly controlled . 
and it certainly looks like it . 
to do this though , we need to redesign education in a major way , to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication , and explicitly train people how to contribute to , and benefit from other disciplines . 
i spent a week at sea on a research vessel . 
our leaders barrel into wars , telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades . 
given the stakes , the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle - - the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible , we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty . 
the flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted , chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides . 
whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them , our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature - - the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer , the narrative of manifest destiny , the narrative of apocalypse and salvation . 
they were just beyond our sights . 
the twin message is as comforting as it is mad . 
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall . 
there will always be another frontier . 
so to get at it , you first have to get rid of the trees . 
vast , vivid landscapes are being gutted , left monochromatic gray . 
how else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ? 
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest - emitting stuff imaginable . 
nevertheless , the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles , particularly media circles , with a relief tinged with euphoria . 
an escape hatch has been reached . 
we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks - - risks that confront recklessness head on , that put the precautionary principle into practice , even if that means through direct action - - like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested , blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop - removal coal mining . 
there is no escape hatch . 
well how would you go about it ? 
and what you might get - - and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to , you throw away . 
and if you take a look at that , this was actually in a book that i wrote that deals with artificial life . 
so having seen this work , worked a little bit on this , this is where i came in . 
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types . 
and then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation , like this one , which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before , until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved . 
so that inspired me to think about , well , what if i try to use this idea in order , not to detect random texts from texts with meaning , but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life . 
so this also turns out to be extremely robust . 
and so now we can see , is that really a robust signature ? 
and now what i did there is , i was being nasty , i just turned up the heat again and again . 
you hit the viability threshold . 
and then , once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self - reproduce , you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes . 
they may have to be dealt with with military means , but they cannot be solved by military means . 
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them . 
you cannot talk to everybody all the time . 
let me go one step further . 
how will we ever be interlocutors ? 
now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid . 
talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion . 
so if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come , we will further radicalization , i believe . 
and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy , if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states , there are some rewards on the other side . 
we need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem - solving forward . 
we want to play you one more selection . 
it was more atonal and twelve - tone . 
and he insisted on beautiful music . 
essentially , for three reasons : calculation , application , and last , and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it , inspiration . 
now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways . 
then one plus two is three , two plus three is five , three plus five is eight , and so on . 
but check this out . 
one plus one gives us two , and one plus four gives us five . 
and four plus nine is 13 , nine plus 25 is 34 , and yes , the pattern continues . 
so one plus one plus four is six . 
just as we created it . 
now check this out . 
and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number , then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1 . 618 , known to many people as the golden ratio , a number which has fascinated mathematicians , scientists and artists for centuries . 
open - ended , open hearth , open source , open door policy , open bar . 
so we saw the protestant reformation . 
but it came with a cost . 
the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge . 
there is a deep resonance with being at rest . 
this is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if i leave it on . 
the third way in which sound affects you is cognitively . 
you are one third as productive in open - plan offices as in quiet rooms . 
put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be . 
most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental , and even hostile , and it has a dramatic effect on sales . 
they are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster , or just turning around on the door . 
the younger , maybe not . 
let me just talk about brands for a moment , because some of you run brands . every brand is out there making sound right now . 
there are eight expressions of a brand in sound . 
1 . 8 billion times a day , that tune is played . 
first , make it congruent , pointing in the same direction as your visual communication . 
that increases impact by over 1 , 100 percent . 
if your sound is pointing the opposite direction , incongruent , you reduce impact by 86 percent . 
thirdly , make it valuable . give people something with the sound . 
i recommend at least five minutes a day , but there is no maximum dose . 
the pack stays together . 
how do we spoil it ? well how do we spoil anything ? 
i was injured all my life , and then in my early 40s i got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too . 
life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness . 
people actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole . 
they get up just a little bit later every day - - say 15 minutes or so - - and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks . 
they go to bed around 8 : 00 p . m . 
and in - between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed . 
so , cut to the modern day . 
so identity was primarily defined by ethnicity , and the nation - state reflected that . 
the age of behavior : where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances . 
so as i said , we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it . 
in others , kosher and halal meat are being banned , as we speak . 
is it just about a lack of education ? 
what that will do is avoid the problem i was talking about earlier , where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy . 
whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level , rather than merely on a political level , a level above politics - - movements that are not political parties , but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture . 
we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions , loosely based political coalitions , to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground . 
in the following year . 
next , raising the money to fund the procedure . 
the truth is , there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around . 
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant . 
but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs , the gift of life was then extended from living , related donors to now living , unrelated donors . 
no doubt , i was informed , the consent had been obtained . 
the observation that stem cells , as master cells , could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types - - heart cells , liver cells , pancreatic islet cells - - captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public . 
and here is the limitation : adult stem cells are mature cells , and , like mature human beings , these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types , as embryonic stem cells & # 91 ; can & # 93 ; . 
and in our lab , we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells - - cells that we may use to then form other , more specialized , cells , which one day may be used as cell transplants . 
and i started to see floaters and stars , which i casually dismissed as too much high - altitude sun exposure . 
and in the u . k . , neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial . 
this was kind of the defining slogan . 
well i took one year . 
so i just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside . 
but this is very shaky . 
you can make a joint of four . you can make a joint of six . 
now this was - - you make a joint of six , you make an icosahedron . 
this is one - way traffic . 
right . 
the insects are eaten by the frogs ; the frogs are eaten by the snakes ; the snakes are eaten by the eagles . 
and this costs very little money to make - - great fun for children to do . 
they get a thrill of what science is all about . 
so no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations . 
and something very , very nice happens . 
they were singing and dancing . 
a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down . 
and another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down . 
this swallows the bridge and knocks it down . 
when the disease hit so close to home , i knew i needed to learn more , so i went online to find answers . 
essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages , but also only in cancer . 
and so then , three months later , i finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy , and i get into his lab , i get all excited , and then i sit down , i start opening my mouth and talking , and five seconds later he calls in another ph . d . 
this makes it 168 times faster , over 26 , 000 times less expensive , and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection . 
and so in the next two to five years , this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal 5 . 5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer . 
nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash . 
you heat up one side , the hot side . 
but it was kind of an interesting thought . 
so , this is the way it works . 
you put it on a cooking fire . 
but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being - - things like your family relationships , friendship , community , values - - then , actually , this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics . 
now , if you combine this very simple , very conservative thought - - go with the grain of human nature - - with all the advances in behavioral economics , some of which we were just hearing about , again , i think we can achieve a real increase in well - being , in happiness , in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money . 
and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully . there we are . 
it was able - - but only it was able - - to organize health care , education , policing , justice . 
and it was a world of , as i say , not local power , but now central power . 
it was able to do that itself . 
just consider this one fact : one hundred years ago , sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars . 
so , how could this happen ? 
in this country , if we win the election , we are going to make all government spending over 25 , 000 pounds transparent and available online , searchable for anyone to see . 
we should be making this change with the information revolution in our country , with searchable health sites , so you can see what operations work out properly , what records doctors have , the cleanliness of hospitals , who does best at infection control - - all of the information that would once be locked in the department of health is now available for all of us to see . 
now i also said the other principle that i think we should work on is understanding of people , is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more . 
why ? it cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time . 
how do you do it ? 
look at what this does . this is a simple piece of behavioral economics . 
the best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending , to show them what their neighbors are spending , and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending . 
here are my two favorite u . s . speeches of the last 50 years . 
it measures neither our wit nor our courage , neither our wisdom nor our learning , neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country . 
again , a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago , and a beautiful dream 40 years ago , but now with the huge advances in information technology , with the massive changes in behavioral economics , with all that we know about how you advance well - being , that if we combine those insights of giving power to people , and using information to make that possible , and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature , while at the same time , understanding why people behave in the way they do , it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago . 
now in the old days , conducting , music making , was less about trust and more , frankly , about coercion . 
so in order for all this to work , obviously i have got to be in a position of trust . 
you overcompensate . 
and i remember at the beginning of my career , again and again , on these dismal outings with orchestras , i would be going completely insane on the podium , trying to engender a small scale crescendo really , just a little upsurge in volume . 
and in the last years of the old regime , he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community . 
will you have a go for me ? 
so i find myself asking : where is music in all of this ? 
i become alive . 
feminism was the water i grew up in . 
so what very profound epiphany , you might ask , was responsible for my feminist click moment ? 
many in my generation - - because of well - intentioned parenting and self - esteem education - - were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes - - who were going to go out and save the world . 
these are three words many of us were raised with . 
growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well . 
instead , what she really wanted to do was make films . 
she was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating carpools , she was consoling friends - - all these daily acts of care and creativity . 
the activists i interviewed had nothing in common , literally , except for one thing , which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences . 
they talk to them about how when they die , they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk , how there will be 72 virgins waiting for them in paradise , how there will be unlimited food , and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods . 
but only if i get permission from my dad . 
we got a problem , folks . 
so it got me thinking , what is it ? 
the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur was race to the top for education . 
forty - eight states opted in , creating a national & # 91 ; education & # 93 ; policy from the bottom up . 
thank you all so much . 
how much stuff goes through your life , how much waste is left behind you . 
and we , at the moment , in our society , have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this . 
this is producing all sorts of tensions , all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing . 
you know , so on the one hand we have the unthinkable ; on the other hand we have the unimaginable . 
give you a little peek into our editorial notebook . 
so you have density . you also have growth management . 
you leave aside what is natural to be natural . 
you can start doing things like , you know , transit systems that actually work to transport people , in effective and reasonably comfortable manners . 
you can start to know where things are . 
many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful , and also much more effective . 
so i rather like this picture here . 
we tweak that a lot . 
ok , so , much , much better than the average crowd , i can tell you that . 
i would keep your eye on this fellow . 
you get grassroots solutions , things that work for people who have no capital or limited access . 
you get access to distance medicine . 
i just love this , you know - - i mean carrying water is such a drag , and somebody just came up with the idea of well , what if you rolled it . right ? 
basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips . 
so , you know , people who are in desperate straits can get this . 
new models for pedagogy for the displaced . 
so does that . 
these are when . 
but he comes up with that , you know . 
put a crab inside it . 
first , soon , and then a lot . 
think about it , a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance . 
its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie . 
and that can have dramatic costs for us . 
deception is actually serious business . 
now granted , many of those are white lies . 
they manipulate via flattery . 
nine - year - olds , masters of the cover up . 
well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass . 
you can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks . 
and if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks , an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment . 
that person may be withdrawn , look down , lower their voice , pause , be kind of herky - jerky . 
happy to take a paternity test , and would love to see it happen . 
when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash . 
make your best guess . 
by a show of hands , were you right ? 
just hold still where you are . 
pardon me . 
one time a guy had a hole in his pocket , and that was rather traumatizing for me . 
go ahead and take it off . 
he throws the first mate to the ground . 
hilarity ensues . 
there is first , the present self . 
he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification . 
and when you try to execute these commitment devices , you realize the devil is really in the details . 
such it is with commitment devices . 
yes , this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement . 
other conditions show people the future self . 
we are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly , and in many of the places where it counts the most , women are , in fact , taking control of everything . 
not a lot of women did . 
so the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men , believe it or not , and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture - - what our romantic comedies look like , what our marriages look like , what our dating lives look like , and our new set of superheroes . 
i was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else , and i started to notice a distinct pattern - - that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women . 
and now look at this second set of slides . 
they were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future . 
and they expected that it would be young families , or young men , just like it had always been . 
and so they decided , because they were intrigued by this finding , to do a nationwide survey . 
it means that the economy is dividing into high - skill , high - wage jobs and low - skill , low - wage jobs - - and that the middle , the middle - skill jobs , and the middle - earning jobs , are starting to drop out of the economy . 
the men sort of stagnate there , while the women zoom up in those high - skill jobs . 
you would be issuing orders from above . 
now the boy crisis is this idea that very young boys , for whatever reason , are doing worse in school than very young girls , and people have theories about that . 
on the board today for losing recess tomorrow , only boys . 
and this was very disheartening for them . 
they basically enshrined the second - class status of women in the civil code . 
we have the charmless misanthrope . 
bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood . 
and as soon as that happened , the birds started moving in . 
why would that possibly have happened ? 
what megafauna , you say ? 
why do understory trees , which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees , why are they so much tougher and harder to break elephants . 
and as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes . 
it just becomes intolerable . 
so where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way : through art , through meditation , through understanding , through knowledge actually , knowing that you have no such boundary , knowing your interconnectedness with other beings . 
it would be terrible . 
you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is , how it can be changed . 
but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is , he will , he did . 
he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings . 
and he would have tremendous fun doing that . 
so , my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole . 
so , this is a little tricky . 
and that buys us about a factor of 20 . 
what you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole . 
likewise , for the young stars , or in contrast , the young stars , they just should not be there . 
so , you can already see the surprise . 
he got his name from fighting stark naked . 
and that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non - aggressively . 
and all this against incredible logistical odds , like heat and traffic jams . 
running the gauntlet through hostile crowds , and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury . 
when we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things . 
but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe . 
in this time , it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died . 
there is still no electricity in my village . 
and the women , the men , everybody from the village , was part of this building process . 
so we just bring them like you can see to the building site . 
i have become myself known . 
i hope now that i was able to make my community proud through this work , and i hope i was able to prove you the power of community , and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future . 
merci beaucoup . 
exact equivalent . 
some lasted 14 - and - a - half minutes . 
they were doing fine . 
so this has applications in all walks of life . 
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions . 
it felt wrong to do that in some way . 
the areas that are the most significant to us . 
and there is no odyssey to our own moon , much less the moons of jupiter . 
and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case . 
there is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify all of the risk factors that we have as individuals . 
but who is going to pay for all this ? 
that is going to be the it challenge of the next generation , is communicating all this information . 
the approval process is going to fall apart , actually . 
we look the same to a visitor from another planet , maybe , but not to each other because we compete with each other all time . 
a generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen . 
you take a six to eight cell embryo , you tease out one of the cells , you run a genetic test on that cell , and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard it . 
as that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization , to the wealthy who want to protect their children , to just about everybody else . 
they are really going to come to operate in this realm . 
it is being funded very very - - in a big way . 
the lines are going to blur . and they already are between therapy and enhancement , between treatment and prevention , between need and desire . 
they undoubtedly will . they have . 
but ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development elsewhere . 
some people are going to see this as an abomination , as the worst thing , as just awful . 
there is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well . 
so here we are . 
and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time . 
where there is this bloody , awful mess happens . 
and then what comes out of it ? new life . 
actually as was pointed out earlier , we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there . 
it is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life . 
i think that we should be proud of it . 
we are , definitely . 
boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school . 
and as you all know , boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder - - and therefore we drug them with ritalin . 
intimacy means physical , emotional connection with somebody else - - and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous , contradictory , phosphorescent signals . 
and this is two kinds . 
for the last 30 years , political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout , and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting . 
basically this was also a major outbreak , a culture of dissent , a culture of basically non - conformism , which was not known before . 
so this is what went right . 
all this was very much under attack . 
because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most . 
this is probably true . 
are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues , are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions , even the very wrong positions , because consistency is going to be more important than common sense ? 
he got dementia anyway . 
and reading is just about impossible . 
he was a college professor at a state school ; he knows what paperwork looks like . 
but it got me thinking , what would my caregivers do with me ? 
that all seems like win to me . 
and what i need now is to learn to be like that . 
somebody , some people - - and i saw somebody kind of make the motion over here - - some people have a great idea where they light the match , melt the side of the candle , try to adhere it to the wall . 
three and a half minutes longer . now this makes no sense right ? 
let me show you what i mean . 
that routine , rule - based , left - brain work - - certain kinds of accounting , certain kinds of financial analysis , certain kinds of computer programming - - has become fairly easy to outsource , fairly easy to automate . 
so what really matters are the more right - brained creative , conceptual kinds of abilities . 
the solution , if it exists at all , is surprising and not obvious . 
now , i mean it makes me crazy . 
okay ? if you do really well you get the large reward , on down . 
what happened ? as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected : the higher the pay , the better the performance . 
is this some kind of touchy - feely socialist conspiracy going on here ? 
the federal reserve bank of the united states . 
and what worries me , as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse , is that too many organizations are making their decisions , their policies about talent and people , based on assumptions that are outdated , unexamined , and rooted more in folklore than in science . 
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess , and if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick . 
i want to talk today only about autonomy . 
in the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management . 
and they do something incredibly cool . 
what happens ? 
well - compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time . 
intrinsic motivation , autonomy , mastery and purpose , in a knockout . let me wrap up . 
the drive to do things cause they matter . 
so , if we repair this mismatch between what science knows and what business does , if we bring our motivation , notions of motivation into the 21st century , if we get past this lazy , dangerous , ideology of carrots and sticks , we can strengthen our businesses , we can solve a lot of those candle problems , and maybe , maybe , maybe we can change the world . 
i rest my case . 
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood . 
she had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage , sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the 12 or 13 family members who were counting on her for survival . 
why is that ? 
it is much riskier to give a 50 , 000 dollar loan than it is to give a 500 dollar loan . 
it is the landscape , right ? 
so our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes . 
so here is a typical stud wall , an architectural construction , and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house , where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation , cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows . 
there was no money involved . 
and this material really did work for a woman equally as well . 
what , if i were to boil it down , would be the one image that i could hang my hat on for this ? 
my dad was a high - ranking gang member who ran the streets . 
everyone knew who i was , so i thought i was a pretty big deal , and i was protected , and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail , i had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent . 
man , her office was packed . 
not so much . 
it was gang - infested , huge teacher turnover rate . 
there were some people who were really gang - affiliated , and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school . 
you just had to do things sometimes . 
she has an issue with authority . 
some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause . 
and i am going to be their help along the way . 
and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding , for support . 
our community deserved a new way of doing things . 
and it was out of fear - - fear of , well , what if they get it wrong ? 
but what if we get it right ? 
so in our third year , how did we do it ? 
they deserve a quality school in their neighborhood , a school that they can be proud to say they attend , and a school that the community can be proud of as well , and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances . 
and i did that ; i put on my ritualistic dress ; i went to the holy mosque ; i did my prayers ; i observed all the rituals . 
but apparently that was not an issue at the time . 
so the rituals came that way . 
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality . 
it is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure . 
the same thing can be said for honor killings , which is a recurrent theme in the western media - - and which is , of course , a horrible tradition . 
and in place of that , what happens is that islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian , which is quite strident , which is quite anti - western , and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision . 
you have anti - colonization . 
there was one country , though , which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle . 
not very many of you . 
bless you . 
and this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions . 
this is how we see a rainforest , in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another . 
i just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet , but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it . 
i mean like once i pick up one book i cannot put it down until i finish the whole book . 
not only do our children cope very well , but they excel in it . 
fathers have started to attend . 
so , you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from . 
such beautiful food , i enjoyed it . it was so beautiful . 
but we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time , not get bogged with numbers , and actually see the child complete the circle of life , and unleash his total potential . 
you gotta push through shyness and self - doubt . 
you gotta persist through failure . you gotta persist through crap ! 
they bring out the issues of stigma . 
my subject today is learning . 
and in that spirit , i want to spring on you all a pop quiz . 
well today i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible , but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology . 
now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me . 
i was myself pregnant while i was doing the research for the book . 
and because the fetus is with her all the time , it hears her voice a lot . 
scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored . 
my favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born . 
now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ? 
from the moment of birth , the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it - - its mother . 
the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid , which is continuously swallowed by the fetus . 
the offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot - flavored cereal , and from the looks of it , they seemed to enjoy it more . 
what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat . 
but actually , the nine - month - long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that . 
and often it does something more . 
the specter of mass starvation loomed . 
some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths , birth defects , low birth weights and infant mortality . 
one explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation . 
this keeps the fetus alive in the short - term , but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs , deprived early on , become more susceptible to disease . 
it seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly . 
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty . 
when the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster - - the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart - pounding fear for their lives . 
now consider this : post - traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong , causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering . 
what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances . 
a year ago , i spoke to you about a book that i was just in the process of completing , that has come out in the interim , and i would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired . 
they coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme , in which no difference is coded as purple , and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation . 
well , pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters , death threats , ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals , coming from irate left - handers and their advocates , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired . 
the only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres . 
one of them is in elite art since the 1930s - - say , the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras , where most of the repertory is before 1930 , or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums . 
indeed , in movements of modernism and post - modernism , there was visual art without beauty , literature without narrative and plot , poetry without meter and rhyme , architecture and planning without ornament , human scale , green space and natural light , music without melody and rhythm , and criticism without clarity , attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition . 
i think that the sciences of human nature - - behavioral genetics , evolutionary psychology , neuroscience , cognitive science - - are going to , increasingly in the years to come , upset various dogmas , careers and deeply - held political belief systems . 
he had been there and watched it go off . 
every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park . 
and so ever since i think i was just six years old , i dreamed of going to the polar regions . 
i have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much . 
and i have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice . 
and so i had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task . 
and i had to visualize the swim . 
so we stopped the ship , as you do . 
i have never in my life felt anything like that moment . 
i could barely breathe . i was gasping for air . 
and i remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock , because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages . 
and they had burst . and i was in so much agony . 
and this dream which i had had ever since i was a young boy with my father , was just going out the window . 
there is no possibility that this was going to happen . 
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out . 
and i just , i got so much confidence from him saying that , because he knew me so well . 
so we carried on sailing and we arrived at the north pole . 
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big chunks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black . 
it was absolutely magical . 
lewis pugh : ten seconds to swim . ten seconds to swim . 
take the goggles off . take the goggles off ! 
against the current ! you did it against the current ! 
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much . 
and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life . 
do you enjoy looking non - symmetric ? 
do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ? 
none of those happened . 
and he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test . 
so i looked carefully at this guy . 
i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through . 
in my mind , i was actually a knight trying to help science move along . 
i was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions . 
and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances . 
oh , my god . 
what ? 
repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen . 
any time you have a goal , there are some steps that need to be done , some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it . 
it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles . 
mothers are like that . 
and in my mind , i just kind of raced ahead and thought of what i was going to say back , while they were still finishing up . 
and then i would launch in . 
well , that just ended communication . 
well , that lasted 17 years . 
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion . 
i just backed out of that , you know , and i just kind of kept the fists from flying . 
how could that be , how could that be ? 
and i started walking off . 
i had no idea i would have a ph . d . 
in summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . and i mean it . 
then , i started drilling down , thinking about the computations i might want to do , trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible . 
but i wanted to look not at the astronomical universe , but at the computational universe . 
you can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here . 
it also brings up new issues , though , like computational irreducibility . 
well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology . 
the idea is that we can just type this in , this kind of question in , however we think of it . 
to be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have , not by searching what other people may have written down before , but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific questions . 
given raw facts or data to actually answer questions , one has to compute : one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries . 
two big things happened : first , a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe ; and second , the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language . 
well , so , that leads to kind of an ultimate question : could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe ? 
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid . 
and each possible rule , in a sense , corresponds to a candidate universe . 
a few years ago , i was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity , and even general relativity and gravitation , and at least give hints of quantum mechanics . 
so , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk . 
and it was while i was doing my ph . d . 
it seemed so intuitive to me . 
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non - invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children . 
so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved . 
let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds . 
all these things , they come back to plants . 
i think it does . 
is by storing seeds . 
but it goes down below ground many stories . 
this is a nuclear - proof facility . 
god forbid that it should have to withstand that . 
and those are the dry land species . 
so first of all we did deals with 50 different countries . 
it means negotiating with heads of state , and with secretaries of state in 50 countries to sign treaties . 
and they go back when their seeds have arrived . 
the seeds - - some of if is very untechnical . 
and these seeds will be able to germinate , we believe , with many of the species , in thousands of years , and certainly in hundreds of years . 
and this is a distributed network . 
so where have we got to ? 
ten percent of all plant species on the planet , 24 , 000 species are safe ; 30 , 000 species , if we get the funding , by next year . 
some of these plants , like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen , they are down to the last few remaining members . 
fantastically useful plant , both for protein and for medicine . 
you walk there , and it hurts . 
i have to take a moment . 
i was hanging on to have a pee . 
i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough , that would guide me through the 18 minutes . 
so we go . we look at the tooling . we look at how that is produced . 
it felt like nothing . it has to feel like nothing . 
it makes the product strong , the tessellation . 
this is the freaky side coming out . 
it contributes immensely to our sense of being , our sense of relationships with things , our sensuality and , you know , the sort of - - even the sort of socio - erotic side , which is very important . 
these actually are sold as artwork . 
the coring out of the back lets you breathe . 
this kind of effervescent , fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas . 
that is an image of a car for me . 
cars are all wrong . 
they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this . 
you plug them in . off you jolly well go . 
it cost me 250 , 000 dollars to build this . 
if all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together , it would be a joy , absolute joy . 
it was frightening , and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell . 
well then we hit a deep depression , and we seriously submerged the vehicle . 
and surprisingly , it became a cult film . 
sleep deprivation is extreme . 
this elephant , against overwhelming odds , simply gives up hope . 
these are precious to us , these divides . 
it was like watching a graduation ceremony . 
we felt like we were surrogate parents . 
a new male comes into the area and takes over the pride , and , of course , first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs . 
when i was 14 years old , i had low self - esteem . 
and then will come what they call the heart , the lush heart note . 
i will show it to you . 
smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person . 
ok , now . why does this thing smell of cut grass , ok ? 
but the first theory is : it must be the shape . 
you have a molecule coming in , it gets into the protein , which is schematic here , and it causes this thing to switch , to turn , to move in some way by binding in certain parts . 
this actually is roughly , in man - years of work , 200 , 000 dollars roughly , if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits . 
a theory is something that enables you to do less work . 
we have to go a little beyond that . now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it . these molecules , as you saw in the beginning , the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other . 
now , this is a spectroscope , ok , on my laboratory bench . 
ok . now . if something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel . 
so nobody likes particularly to - - you know , aftershave with carcinogens . 
and people are very resistant to ideas , and rightly so . 
or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent . 
so thinking of emotions as the opposite of - - as something less than thinking is immensely productive . and i hope , in the next few years , to show that this will lead to smart machines . 
and i guess i better skip all the rest of this , which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and - - - - and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you . 
so i think the future , main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments , types of situations , types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up . 
okay , outstanding . so i invented that . 
then comes the first part of the question . 
then comes my favorite part of the question . 
and then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing . 
okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough . 
the first one is a lack of bilinguals . 
cognitively , they can understand artificially - created languages . 
and they pass self - awareness tests in mirrors . 
and they have touch . 
another well studied sound are echolocation clicks . 
but they can also tightly pack these clicks together into buzzes and use them socially . 
i wish i was that coordinated . 
so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin . 
so the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer , and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other . 
they might do it in captivity , but in the wild - - so we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water , and we labeled four objects they like to play with , the scarf , rope , sargassum , and also had a bow ride , which is a fun activity for a dolphin . 
up come the dolphins , and drop off the rope , yay . wow . 
so this is only once . 
whoop . almost lost it . 
so diver a and diver b both have a wearable computer and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle , the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water , but also as a word through bone conduction . 
so diver a plays the scarf whistle or diver b plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it . 
when i was growing up , i was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale . 
and i was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications i was seeing felt soulless and cold . 
and there on the smaller scale , the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument , was a materiality and a soulfulness . 
i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that . 
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy . 
so we looked at how we could compose all those elements - - instead of just litter , create one composition . 
so it felt this has a social dimension . 
it has a symbolic importance . 
and we should be proud of where our power is coming from , rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of . 
because just that soil could make the acoustic difference . 
and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost - effective way of making a structure to do this . 
it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top . 
so people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area , and use that height that we have to have for its function . 
we won the competition , and it was painful to get there . 
so we won the competition to build the u . k . pavilion . 
and an expo is a totally bonkers thing . 
and 250 countries all competing . 
and so that became the governmental goal - - is , how do you stand out in this chaos , which is an expo of stimulus ? 
so our sense was we had to do one thing , and only one thing , instead of trying to have everything . 
so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral . 
so we were trying to think , how could we make a whole thing emanate . 
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations . 
so that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch . 
and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue . 
so the idea was to take these 66 , 000 seeds that they agreed to give us , and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box , very simple box element , and make it a building that could move in the wind . 
and to make the project affordable , we focused our energy . 
and with a million people there a day , it just felt like offering some public space . 
but there was an underlying support . 
and so there was a moment when suddenly - - actually , the next thing . 
the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this . 
so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom , we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer . 
but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape , rather than engulf it . 
since we have an extra minute here , i thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds , which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building . 
so there were 66 , 000 of these . 
and so the daylight was just coming - - it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed . 
right ? 
best dancer walks tall , gets the best date . 
also , the system is self - fueling . 
invite the crowd , let in the light , dial up the desire . 
but you can publish your stuff online . 
and if you can get that wheel to turn , look out . 
by opening up our translation program , thousands of heroic volunteers - - some of them watching online right now , and thank you ! - - have translated our talks into more than 70 languages , thereby tripling our viewership in non - english - speaking countries . 
suddenly , here we are . 
it packs a huge amount of data , and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it . 
and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online , inspire each other to greatness . 
why would someone bother ? 
i mean , this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action . 
print scaled . 
that just went global . 
i mean , does it have to be this painful , top - down process ? 
they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way , and maybe censors that natural curiosity , or you know , reins in the question - asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids . 
somebody that might even be super - abled . 
what is a sexy body ? 
poetry matters . 
and even at this point , i started to move away from the need to replicate human - ness as the only aesthetic ideal . 
so whimsy matters . 
today , i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me , and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet , and i can change my height - - i have a variable of five different heights . 
it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space . 
i say , less and less the human touch . 
these trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination . 
and the official truth , the truth was , the law was , that a black man was a property , was a thing , you see . 
so this piece is about a negative imagination . 
it raises questions about what nature is , what mother nature is , and about what a risk can be . 
and i failed them dramatically , because i allowed it to go on and on and on . 
and she would hit her head on the tub . it happened continuously , repeatedly . 
all around her head was just swollen ; her head was about two sizes of its own size . 
he went in to check on her for school , and he got very excited . 
so we went to the mall and we told a police that we had , like , lost her , that she was missing . 
and we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her . 
and he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway . 
it was captured on videotape - - technology - - and it was played all over the world . 
they did not , so there were riots . 
and that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent . i was at that trial . 
explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way . 
he is the model of non - violence , non - violence - - and they would all like to be in his spirit . 
the fire is still there . how do you say it ? & # 91 ; unclear & # 93 ; . 
igniting , igniting , igniting fire . igniting fire . 
and they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out . 
followed by that , you see on the west coast planes moving across , the red - eye flights to the east coast . 
this is scrolling up the east coast . 
kind of amazing what some people did . 
approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour , which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour . 
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication . 
you see some people did beautiful stipple renderings , like this one on top - - spent a long time making realistic versions . 
this is what that sounded like . 
this is what it would look like if you went to the site . 
so basically motion through 3d space . 
collaborator : i felt really sad when he died . 
collaborator two : it really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial . 
collaborator five : as much as is different from frame to frame , it really is personal . 
and i just worked and worked through problems , until my little wee battles that i was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves . 
if you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails , you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located . 
and as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data , we have an opportunity , and maybe even an obligation , to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together . 
a giant battery could . 
we need to think big , we need to think cheap . 
and in order to adopt a fresh perspective , i sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage . 
i recall the very moment one day when i was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance , different , opposite density and high mutual reactivity . 
it could be something like a wind farm . 
avoid thermal runaway . 
now , i should tell you that i have no idea what psychophysics is , although at some point in my life , i dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics . 
as far as i know , psychophysics is about measuring things . 
anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough ; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet . 
you know , maybe we made an error somewhere along the way . 
and this was not good enough for him , and this question bedeviled him for years . 
and he would think it through and say , what was wrong ? 
tried to get business , nobody would hire him - - he was obsessed , though , and he talked about it and talked about it and talked about it . 
every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce , he varied spaghetti sauce . 
and then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces , and he went on the road . 
and he sat them down for two hours , and he gave them , over the course of that two hours , ten bowls . 
now , did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce ? no ! 
there are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain ; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy ; and there are people who like it extra chunky . 
takes over the mustard business ! 
now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well . 
the culture of tomato sauce was thin . 
so the cop takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about two , three minutes . no keys . 
it kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was . 
because if we can do that , if we can actually just collect the data electronically , digitally , from the very beginning , we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing , of having somebody type that stuff into the computer . 
and it actually worked great . 
it worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted . 
and so i began to wrack my brain trying to think about , you know , what was the process that i was doing , how was i training folks , and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently ? 
so what do i mean by that ? 
and so i began to think of ways in which i could basically take myself out of the picture . 
and you go out there , and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you spend & # 91 ; on a & # 93 ; hotel and you spend all that stuff . 
so there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work , i think , in many areas of human problem solving , particularly those which involve human psychology , which is : the tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible , as much compulsion as possible , whereas actually , the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied . 
because it does seem to me that large organizations including government , which is , of course , the largest organization of all , have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people . 
just interested , did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all ? 
has anybody stayed there ? 
nothing unusual about that at all , except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor . 
it was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by , not only making it a social event - - i think good use of behavioral economics in that , if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated , your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone . 
but secondly , to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated . 
so i did come up with five suggestions , which they are actually actioning . 
and yet , it never happens . 
unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger - all . 
and if actually we created a ministry of detail and business actually had chief detail officers , then that fourth quadrant , which is so woefully neglected at the moment , might finally get the attention it deserves . 
when she got up to make tea , she placed him in my own lap and i had never felt a child that was that emaciated . 
before i left , i actually asked him if i could get him something . 
so a few of the stories . 
it was just frightening . 
they freak out . 
do you see the subject ? 
well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects . 
we started from social media data , we combined it statistically with data from u . s . government social security , and we ended up predicting social security numbers , which in the united states are extremely sensitive information . 
so if you combine the two studies together , then the question becomes , can you start from a face and , using facial recognition , find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person , and from that publicly available information infer non - publicly available information , much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face ? 
in fact , take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme . 
now interestingly , among our subjects , some had posted comparable information , and some had not . 
do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview ? 
if you think so , then you are not like the u . s . employers who are , in fact , part of our experiment , meaning we did exactly that . 
now , that movie is set in 2054 , about 40 years from now , and as exciting as that technology looks , it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you , and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect . 
but then we added the misdirection . 
we can browse the internet anonymously . 
we can have even privacy - preserving data mining . 
i know what i have just said is simply not obvious . 
government protesters became sideline cheerleaders . 
we include everyone : the young , the elderly , the disabled , the mentally challenged , the blind , the elite , the amateur runners , even moms with their babies . 
it , however , is enormous in both scale and importance . 
she still made the two - hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors . 
in the 20th century , it was totalitarianism . 
hands up , please . 
in fact , demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population . 
and , you know , it happens for several reasons . 
from one to five , girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys , in all of india . 
poverty , for instance . 
there are three reasons why this is the case . 
so research has shown , if you look at people who live under two dollars a day - - one metric of poverty - - two percent of that take - home pay goes to this basket here , in education . 
if you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket , you would have a transformative effect . 
you need to use scarce resources . 
however , two - thirds of the way there was a barrier . 
i would say , on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking . 
now , modern slavery : according to state department rough statistics , there are about 800 , 000 - - 10 times the number - - that are trafficked across international borders . 
and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders , which is a substantial portion . 
you know , childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event . 
she fought off the hyenas with that stick . 
so of course , when you educate a girl , she tends to get married later on in life , she tends to have kids later on in life , she tends to have fewer kids , and those kids that she does have , she educates them in a more enlightened fashion . 
and at the time , she was miserable . 
he was kind of a gambler type - - and unemployable , therefore - - and took his frustrations out on her . 
pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her embroidery business . 
the twins started producing milk . 
she stayed at the top of her class through elementary school , middle school , and then in high school , she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the united states on scholarship . 
so you see how transformative little bits of help can be . 
a few yards away was a failed chicken coop . 
i will just leave you with two things . 
one is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of - - which most of us , all of us , here in this room do - - research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness . 
and she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility . 
so let me ask for a show of hands . 
so , for instance , if you ask , how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis ? 
you sort of place your bets . 
well , what is it to make a therapeutic , anyway ? 
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail . 
that picture you see there ? 
how does that play out in terms of application to a disease ? 
this one is a disorder which is quite rare . 
well that was exciting , but would it actually work in a real human being ? 
and the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this , 28 of them , and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease , all looking quite similar to each other . 
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4 , 000 that are waiting for answers . 
could we , in fact , encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for ? 
that could be a phenomenal , valuable activity . 
so how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort ? 
it completely blows apart the way that perfume is , and provides a whole new format . 
so let me tell you about the three cycles . the first one is the factory cycle . 
people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon . 
and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down , and they burn it down instead , and practice putting it out . 
what they did , though , is each in their own way , created a different way of navigating your way through technology . 
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team . 
and around and around and around it goes . 
something that matters . start . do it . we need it . 
thank you very much . i appreciate it . 
wais divide itself though , is a circle of tents in the snow . 
periodically , they remove a cylinder of ice , like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill . 
they inspect it , they check it for cracks , for drill damage , for spalls , for chips . 
yes , i said that with a q , quadrillion . 
each cylinder is a parfait of time . 
from this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things . 
and this is the object of their scrutiny . 
this process requires extraordinary precautions . 
as they handle the ice , in fact , they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven , so that , when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen , they can don a fresh pair . 
they work against the clock and against the thermometer . 
here , the ice seems a living presence . 
it is a voice we should heed . 
so it kind of cooled my test - driving for a little while . 
today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide . 
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives . 
in fact , my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school . 
would he have had more possibilities in his life ? 
the breeze passes through them . 
so we basically turned the box into a bubble . 
and these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future . 
we pay the bill at the end of the month , but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren . 
how many people times how much water . 
and they work . people use them . people are okay . 
i met a father the other day ; he looked a little crazed . 
this is the school buffalo . 
they took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen , sliced them thinly and made delicious chips . 
we dropped them gently in . 
and all the kids are thriving . 
on giant grass . 
it comes out of the ground like a train . 
we had them engineered by the engineers . 
it was chaos . 
good afternoon . 
some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation - - and obviously , a quite mishandled one . 
and if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary , they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated . 
and this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons . 
and the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile . 
and by specifying eight different goals , the united nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people . 
take child mortality ; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two - thirds , from 1990 to 2015 . 
and this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about & # 91 ; her & # 93 ; birth history . 
but they have good quality . 
but watch out - - they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing . 
it was so tragic . 
this was the estimate of the new survey . 
they start & # 91 ; in & # 93 ; 1990 - - they measure to 2009 . 
there was resistance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs . 
still here , child death per 1 , 000 on that axis . 
here we have & # 91 ; the & # 93 ; year . 
and what has happened over the years since then ? here we go . 
and they are judged , each country , on how they are doing . 
and then , you see , these were famine years . 
and eventually , soon they started to get better and better here . 
and then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later . 
you have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long - term investments . 
we want others to be better than we were , and indeed , others have been better . 
and down they went , you know . 
now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality . 
the relationship between child mortality and family size . 
one , two , three , four children per woman : six , seven , eight children per woman . 
it got down there - - china comes into the western box here . 
there we are today . 
the rest here is good - - the rest is good . 
it came back signed . 
infringement is a lot easier to disprove . 
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way . 
they plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits . 
and as a result , patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between . 
now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright - - although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills - - and then they want to remove them from the domain name system . 
but technology moved on , as technology is wont to do . 
but this taping business , fine , let it go . 
they had wanted congress to outlaw copying full - stop . 
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation . 
we share written things , we share images , we share audio , we share video . 
this is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year . 
so the first question , and you might want to write this down , either on a bit of paper , physically , or a virtual piece of paper in your head . and , for viewers at home , you can try this as well . 
a little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot , right ? 
would you be able to do that ? 
was he beheaded in the end , or hung ? 
a little seed weighs a lot and , basically , all this stuff , 99 percent of this stuff , came out of the air . 
the mass of this comes out of the air . 
i promise you that most of you will have got that . 
other ones are kind of going like this . all right . 
so good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world , right ? 
so , why is it blue on cloudy days ? ah , see . 
just think about this problem for a second . 
so that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations . 
how could we survive that ? 
that is our river . 
and so that number also demands food . 
we only have two days of water reserve . 
these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity . 
and that is a lot of water . 
but what gels all of it , what enables it , is legislation , policies , regulations . 
even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing . 
30 percent of our households gave . 
then we went to work with the manufacturers of aids medicines , one of whom was cited in the film , and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy , because even at 500 dollars , these drugs were being sold on a high - margin , low - volume , uncertain - payment basis . 
but the price went to 140 dollars from 500 . 
the only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose , treat and care for people and deliver this medicine . 
and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it . 
now we have taken on a second thing , and this gets to my wish . 
but the money is there to reach others . 
the systems are not there to reach the people . 
you think about whatever your life has been , however many obstacles you have faced in your life , at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved . 
she and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country . 
and it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it . 
mortality at birth was over two - and - a - half percent . 
less than three - tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second - line drugs . 
perhaps something very naughty . 
and that mind - blowing insight changes the entire game . 
they just go ahead and start a fundraiser . 
what a company . 
as we move to search , we rely on the relevance rankings , the web matching , the index crawling . 
we fly these airplanes at 5 , 000 feet in the air . 
we made it all freely available on the web , just to - - it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause . 
an ortho - view , a nadir - view . how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model ? 
the freshness , the capacity . i can turn this image . 
humans have long held a fascination for the human brain . 
and all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through . 
and each neuron itself is largely unique . 
the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry . 
we get one from mom , one from dad . 
males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life . 
and then what we get is our first mapping . 
you could consider this state boundaries , if you will , those pretty broad outlines . 
then we very carefully melt onto the slide . 
and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this . 
you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places . 
so now we can look throughout the brain . 
and then we find some outliers , some things that lie beyond the cloud . 
i think these resources are incredibly valuable . 
would we see 544 greyhound bus drivers ? 
that is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping . 
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been . 
but elsewhere in the world , if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea , you will get essentially a blank face . 
& # 91 ; $ 60 . 2 billion & # 93 ; now why is this ? 
we are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work . 
nothing to see , move along . 
so i wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness , so i ran away to sea . 
and it was a revelation . 
ships have automation now . 
they can operate with small crews . 
so that was a normal working ship . 
now how is that possible ? 
so we have these very multinational , global , mobile crews on ships . 
there were double pirate watches . 
not all of them , but some of them were , because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners , it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience . 
what else does our sea blindness mask ? 
and shipping is the greenest method of transport . 
but a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean , and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use , then it can damage their acoustic habitat , and they need this for breeding , for finding feeding grounds , for finding mates . 
but there are no laws governing acoustic pollution yet . 
i want to salute the 100 , 000 ships that are at sea that are doing that work , coming in and out every day , bringing us what we need . 
but i also want to see shipping , and us , the general public , who know so little about it , to have a bit more scrutiny , to be a bit more transparent , to have 90 percent transparency . 
crazy , i know . insane . 
my heart was three - and - a - half sizes too big . 
i was very limited by my condition , physically . 
well , the altitude exacerbated my symptoms . 
at 24 , my death would have been entirely expected . 
but his - - well , the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline . 
it was a match . 
i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive . 
he said it would kill me . 
i was 95 lbs . 
my parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place , but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time . 
this is some life - support equipment closed - cycle . 
no hands at the wheel . 
go , go , go . 
that signal was so strong , it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment , collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material . 
that means we get our new hips for free . 
and she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free . 
that is what free gets you . 
i would still be on my bad hip . that was so disappointing . 
this youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line . 
no , no . front of the line . 
so by now i was walking the lobby , and of course , that hurt , because of my hip , and i kind of needed a sign . 
and i saw a sign . 
yeah . they needed some young blood . 
so , naturally , i had my vest and my identification . 
i work with really amazing , little , itty - bitty creatures called cells . 
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little . 
in a sense , tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here , because structural engineers build bridges and big things , computer engineers , computers , but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves . 
i invite you to talk about this with me further , and in the meantime , i wish you luck . 
may none of your non - cancer cells become endangered species . 
so when i say full , i mean really full - - well past any margin for error , well past any dispute about methodology . 
we plan to take this highly - stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big - - not in some distant future , but in less than 40 years , in the life time of most of you . 
and these are not esoteric limits . 
so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly - efficient , solar - powered , knowledge - based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in 2050 a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion . 
it certainly is . 
in my view , it is well underway . 
imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts , when the financial markets recognize that , to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control , the oil and coal industries are finished . 
so what would be better & # 91 ; than & # 93 ; to use the herring gull , in its freedom , circling and swooping over the sea , and & # 91 ; to & # 93 ; use this as a role model ? 
so we bring a team together . 
and this was one issue : to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down . 
so i now would like you to & # 91 ; put & # 93 ; your seat belts on and put your hats & # 91 ; on & # 93 ; . 
that is , you ask any generic question about this - - how many trees of a given size , how many branches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flowing through each branch , what is the size of the canopy , what is its growth , what is its mortality ? 
if you take those networks , this idea of networks , and you apply universal principles , mathematizable , universal principles , all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow , including the description of the forest , the description of your circulatory system , the description within cells . 
there is a scaling . 
there is an economy of scale . 
it scales in the same way everywhere . 
but even more surprising is if you look at socio - economic quantities , quantities that have no analog in biology , that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10 , 000 years ago . 
something universal is going on . 
the universality , to repeat , is us - - that we are the city . 
economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior . 
and indeed , one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super - linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation , then indeed you get , from the same theory , a beautiful rising exponential curve - - lovely . 
what we do is , as we grow and we approach the collapse , a major innovation takes place and we start over again , and we start over again as we approach the next one , and so on . 
see companies , they scale . 
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry - - a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here . 
so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better . 
you get one of these ballot forms at random , and then you go into the voting booth , and you mark your choices , and you tear along a perforation . 
when leaving your laboratory tomorrow , i want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step , struggling to maintain their trunk . 
and my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well - controlled experimental conditions . 
and while this certainly remained the key for a cure , this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me . 
he listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin . 
my idea : replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk . 
we insisted . we refined our paradigm , and after several months of training , the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand , and whenever she decided , initiated full weight - bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards . 
i can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory . 
they are the result of a young team of very talented people : physical therapists , neurobiologists , neurosurgeons , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals . 
because sometimes people from outside the u . k . 
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively u . k . phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles . 
it exists . what is a snob ? 
a snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are . 
that is snobbery . 
the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery . 
i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods . 
there are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies . 
the closer two people are , in age , in background , in the process of identification , the more there is a danger of envy - - which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion - - because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with . 
so there is a spirit of equality , combined with deep inequalities . 
which makes for a very - - can make for a very stressful situation . 
i am a meritocrat in that sense . 
we will never get to grade them , never get to grade people as they should . 
and then are fit for ridicule . 
tragic art , as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece , in the fifth century b . c . , was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail , and also according them a level of sympathy , which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them . 
they really do have a kind of genius all of their own , these guys . 
we like to feel in contact with something that is non - human , and that is so deeply important to us . 
psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years . 
thank you very much . 
that was fascinating . how do you reconcile this idea of someone being - - it being bad to think of someone as a loser with the idea , that a lot of people like , of seizing control of your life . 
and that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers . 
they just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest . 
the phone puts the period , the space , and the capital for you . 
go space , space . it is totally amazing . 
you get it every time . 
have a great day . 
and that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight . 
and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance . 
because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back , it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together . 
so the market is there . 
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know . 
we de - linked that , and once we did it , we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price . 
when they crashed , we crashed . 
that smoothened out . we were able to save , just before i left , 27 billion dollars . whereas - - and this went to our reserves - - when i arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves . 
as telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and i could go on and on . and this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro - economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous . 
this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people . 
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this . 
the supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling . 
the wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous . 
and perhaps , a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it . 
they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text , and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation , they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental , theatrical , simplistic way . 
and i just love this guy . 
his career i admire a lot . 
they are objects of desire . 
and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free , which was kind of what i tried to do . 
so here they are . 
well , i said , you know what , instead of mimicking his style , i might as well call the real guy and ask him , and i sent him my books , and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium . 
so , the first thing that is prioritized is politics . 
so , short - term peacekeepers . 
i think that approach denies reality . 
the donors provide post - conflict aid .

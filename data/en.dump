it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
it actually improves it . 
thank you very much .

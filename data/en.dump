but still , we look at the pieces . 
and this is the tower from below . 
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering . 
we have to get special flight clearance . 
well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that . 
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind . 
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms - - black and white , subtitled , documentary , non - narrative , fantasy - - and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth . 
they are neither feral nor myopically self - absorbed . 
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
so he got the right weight at birth . 
and what went wrong ? 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
porous , nonporous . 
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work . 
do you rip it off quickly - - short duration but high intensity - - or do you take your band - aid off slowly - - you take a long time , but each second is not as painful - - which one of those is the right approach ? 
the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip . 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks - - all kinds of versions of pain . 
and when i finished hurting people a little bit , i would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ? 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
people did this . i would pay people four dollars for their task - - on average people would solve four problems . 
i would pass their sheet of paper . 
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces . 
no bill ever disappeared . 
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ? 
but think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody i liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time . 
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions . 
this is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute . 
any science geeks , you get that one . 
reach behind you . there you go . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
the clientele behavior was very much the same too . 
do i have a place , a venue , in mind when i write ? 
it actually improves it . 
and well , that was an opera experience . 
okay . 
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music . 
the tempos are medium . it sounds big . 
presumably , this is just for christian music . 
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something . 
thank you very much . 
my pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be . 
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . 
and for a few days you got those images . 
and that was the end of it . 
and it goes the other way around . 
now , melting point has a lot to do with this . 
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge . 
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again . 
fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . same thing . 
to start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place . 
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
we just read the back of a label on a packet . 
the ordering principle of his vision . 
cows with a view . 
steaming piles of humus . 
so that became a challenge . 
compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that i was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions . 
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase . 
trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want . 
the lightest touch of her arm - - the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on - - caused excruciating , burning pain . 
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house . 
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life . 
but the third challenge we have - - and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge - - is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy - - every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash . 
and in each of those , it was only part of the country . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
and yet , the impossible is happening . 
it keeps getting reinfected . 
now what about the money ? 
and that great buy costs us a little bit more . 
but soon the idea began spreading virally . 
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending . 
thank you for making your site . 
they can be shocking or silly or soulful . 
growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating - - no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger - - and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects . 
hold your head up . look at me . 
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family . 
and the limousine empties out . 
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box . 
he was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old - - younger guys . 
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys . 
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good . 
he was a troubled kid . 
his grandmother had two jobs . 
he was home alone a lot . 
he was cool . he was fine . 
we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and then you hook up , and you hook up your static line . 
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door . 
in 30 - some years of jumping , i never did one . 
and i realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money i got out of it . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls . 
do your job simply , the girl will chase you . 
this meant they must have been closer together in the past . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
thank you very much indeed . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely . 
he built a playhouse for our daughter . 
so we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
he started it just two weeks ago . 
it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious . 
so what do we make of all of this ? 
and they were readily available . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
on the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom . 
so we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground . 
and the latter won out . 
instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn . . . 
this graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning . 
how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ? 
and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints . 
90 percent of your long - term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world . 
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat . 
the absence of disease is not health . 
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior . 
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise . 
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed . 
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed . 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of . 
and at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first . 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters . 
and finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness . 
and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier . 
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty - six people died . nearly 300 , 000 homes were lost . 
the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff . 
so some solutions to heat can provide for win - win - wins . 
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities . 
hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ? 
now the thing is , i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging . 
and this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me . 
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging . 
you know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100 , 000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ? 
right . so the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ? 
and the fundamental answer is that the pro - aging trance is not as dumb as it looks . 
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self - repair mechanisms , because those self - repair mechanisms are not perfect . 
and there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging . 
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon . 
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today - - or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive - - would actually live ? 
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it . 
we can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like . 
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore . 
that in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle - aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp . 
well , it seems to get the point across . 
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive . 
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit . 
and this is what it is . 
and there are only seven of them . 
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top . 
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ? 
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole . 
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude . 
i could barely breathe . 
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on . 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
i got myself to the side of the lake . 
and my team just gave it to me straight . 
and remember , never ever swim with aggression . 
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift . 
and i ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it . 
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls . 
every now and then , i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally . 
and yet i forget about it all the time . 
it is easy to forget the gasp - inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life . 
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug . 
i took it out for the first time to come here . 
go ! 
should it be by just walking around looking down ? 
this project has lasted now , been just over two years . 
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera . 
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole - hearted living , i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown . 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
and that myth is profoundly dangerous . 
the majority of people .

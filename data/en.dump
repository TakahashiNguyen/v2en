we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and we did an operation , and my company did a dawn attack - - you know , the classic dawn attack : you prepare all night , move to the line of departure . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
and yet , we need to have that shared sense . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
this removes the distinction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state . 
we think we have solved the mystery of creation . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet . 
this brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race . 
it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million . 
but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years , our future is in space . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .

and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
you know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
and this is what it is . 
what i said about there being no non - aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification . 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
go ! 
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera . 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
the majority of people . 
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism . 
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest . 
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire . 
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me . 
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love - - mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other - - are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire . 
our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore . 
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree - - which produced this painting - - moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines . 
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns . 
and kids are working in countless group assignments . 
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well - managed environment and take it from there . 
so they did it with mouse pups , kittens . 
they did it with pigs . 
they did it with puppies . 
and if you can do it with monkeys - - though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes - - if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings . 
be easier to find us at night . 
and eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves - - which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms . 
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being . 
but first , my disclosures . 
but that very fact is telling . 
where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire . 
but it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre - menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent .

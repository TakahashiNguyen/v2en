but still , we look at the pieces . 
and this is the tower from below . 
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering . 
we have to get special flight clearance . 
well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that . 
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind . 
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms - - black and white , subtitled , documentary , non - narrative , fantasy - - and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth . 
they are neither feral nor myopically self - absorbed . 
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
so he got the right weight at birth . 
and what went wrong ? 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
porous , nonporous . 
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work . 
do you rip it off quickly - - short duration but high intensity - - or do you take your band - aid off slowly - - you take a long time , but each second is not as painful - - which one of those is the right approach ? 
the nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip . 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks - - all kinds of versions of pain . 
and when i finished hurting people a little bit , i would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ? 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
people did this . i would pay people four dollars for their task - - on average people would solve four problems . 
i would pass their sheet of paper . 
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces . 
no bill ever disappeared . 
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ? 
but think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody i liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time . 
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions . 
this is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute . 
any science geeks , you get that one . 
reach behind you . there you go . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
the clientele behavior was very much the same too . 
do i have a place , a venue , in mind when i write ? 
it actually improves it . 
and well , that was an opera experience . 
okay . 
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music . 
the tempos are medium . it sounds big . 
presumably , this is just for christian music . 
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something . 
thank you very much . 
my pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be . 
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . 
and for a few days you got those images . 
and that was the end of it . 
and it goes the other way around . 
now , melting point has a lot to do with this . 
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge . 
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again . 
fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . same thing . 
to start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place . 
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
we just read the back of a label on a packet . 
the ordering principle of his vision . 
cows with a view . 
steaming piles of humus . 
so that became a challenge . 
compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that i was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions . 
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase . 
trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want . 
the lightest touch of her arm - - the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on - - caused excruciating , burning pain . 
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house . 
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life . 
but the third challenge we have - - and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge - - is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy - - every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash . 
and in each of those , it was only part of the country . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
and yet , the impossible is happening . 
it keeps getting reinfected . 
now what about the money ? 
and that great buy costs us a little bit more . 
but soon the idea began spreading virally . 
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending . 
thank you for making your site . 
they can be shocking or silly or soulful . 
growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating - - no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger - - and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects . 
hold your head up . look at me . 
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family . 
and the limousine empties out . 
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box . 
he was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old - - younger guys . 
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys . 
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good . 
he was a troubled kid . 
his grandmother had two jobs . 
he was home alone a lot . 
he was cool . he was fine . 
we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and then you hook up , and you hook up your static line . 
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door . 
in 30 - some years of jumping , i never did one . 
and i realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
it makes me to stand here , the fame , the money i got out of it . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls . 
do your job simply , the girl will chase you . 
this meant they must have been closer together in the past . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
thank you very much indeed . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely . 
he built a playhouse for our daughter . 
so we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
he started it just two weeks ago . 
it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious . 
so what do we make of all of this ? 
and they were readily available . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
on the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom . 
so we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground . 
and the latter won out . 
instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn . . . 
this graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning . 
how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ? 
and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints . 
90 percent of your long - term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world . 
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat . 
the absence of disease is not health . 
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior . 
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise . 
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed . 
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed . 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of . 
and at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first . 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters . 
and finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness . 
and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier . 
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty - six people died . nearly 300 , 000 homes were lost . 
the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff . 
so some solutions to heat can provide for win - win - wins . 
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities . 
hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ? 
now the thing is , i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging . 
and this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me . 
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging . 
you know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100 , 000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ? 
right . so the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ? 
and the fundamental answer is that the pro - aging trance is not as dumb as it looks . 
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self - repair mechanisms , because those self - repair mechanisms are not perfect . 
and there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging . 
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon . 
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today - - or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive - - would actually live ? 
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it . 
we can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like . 
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore . 
that in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle - aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp . 
well , it seems to get the point across . 
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive . 
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit . 
and this is what it is . 
and there are only seven of them . 
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top . 
if that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ? 
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole . 
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude . 
i could barely breathe . 
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on . 
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
i got myself to the side of the lake . 
and my team just gave it to me straight . 
and remember , never ever swim with aggression . 
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift . 
and i ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it . 
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls . 
every now and then , i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally . 
and yet i forget about it all the time . 
it is easy to forget the gasp - inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life . 
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug . 
i took it out for the first time to come here . 
go ! 
should it be by just walking around looking down ? 
this project has lasted now , been just over two years . 
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera . 
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole - hearted living , i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown . 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
and that myth is profoundly dangerous . 
the majority of people . 
the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat . 
shame is one , do not be perceived as what ? 
i was in the third year of my seven - year undergraduate degree . 
i took a couple victory laps in there . 
now fast forward to just three years ago . 
could we have people singing together in real time ? 
and praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that . 
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see . 
what is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ? 
on the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence - - all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home . 
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms . 
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism . 
forgone conclusion does not keep our interest . 
basically , when i get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when i can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire . 
basically , when i look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn - on across the board . 
radiant , as in self - sustaining . 
and in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan , lies that movement toward the other . 
and so , when i see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception , and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me . 
is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ? 
now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love - - mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other - - are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire . 
you know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct . 
our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore . 
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end . 
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time . 
are you going to curse me ? are you going to scold me ? 
foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm . 
trees epitomize stasis . 
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree - - which produced this painting - - moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines . 
would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ? 
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce . 
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are - - all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding . 
for one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them . 
but enough of the theory . 
the rocket was huge . 
now we have the good fortune to open up space . 
i had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns . 
i could have told you 50 others just like it - - all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert . 
shyness is about fear of social judgment . 
and kids are working in countless group assignments . 
even in subjects like math and creative writing , which you think would depend on solo flights of thought , kids are now expected to act as committee members . 
and when it comes to leadership , introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though introverts tend to be very careful , much less likely to take outsize risks - - which is something we might all favor nowadays . 
this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity , because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas , but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them . 
so no wilderness , no revelations . 
so . . . 
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well - managed environment and take it from there . 
underneath this ceremonial role , he was really modest and really introverted - - so much so that when he delivered these sermons , he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years . 
number one : stop the madness for constant group work . 
okay , number two : go to the wilderness . 
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in . 
of course , clubs and discos , too . 
so , as you all know , species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments , and the pressures of those environments selected which changes , through random mutation in species , were going to be preserved . 
and that has been the second great - - couple 100 , 000 years , 150 , 000 years - - flow of our evolution . 
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them . 
and they are now making them , and someday , perhaps pretty soon , you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket . 
but something much , much more powerful is happening now . 
and what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light . 
so they did it with mouse pups , kittens . 
they did it with pigs . 
they did it with puppies . 
and , in fact , they did it with monkeys . 
and if you can do it with monkeys - - though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes - - if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings . 
be easier to find us at night . 
in other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed . 
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create . 
that dna is passed down through our mothers . 
it gets worse than that - - or perhaps better than that . 
the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthetic arm would do . 
and eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves - - which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms . 
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator . 
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being . 
this is where we are in this process . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
but first , my disclosures . 
but that very fact is telling . 
where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire . 
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 . 
but it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre - menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent . 
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system . 
our big break came in 2004 . 
after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology . 
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day . 
so , i started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk . 
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it . 
interestingly , what i did with these rollers is , basically , i took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line . 
so , these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly . 
we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things ; what about that ? 
so , rather than waiting for that , i actually made my own , just using a piece of paper . 
so i now have a print - out of that thing , and now - - the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back , rather than now switching between these two worlds . 
this is incredible , really . 
what are you doing with this ? is there a company being planned ? 
common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt . 
and so for her , i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that & # 91 ; knee & # 93 ; joint space . 
and & # 91 ; the allograft & # 93 ; replaces & # 91 ; the missing meniscus & # 93 ; . 
and so with that , coming to a - - coming to an operating theater near you soon , i believe . 
how are we going to feed this world ? 
you get a new disease that can be deadly . 
well they are . 
they just make it & # 91 ; with & # 93 ; nuts or something . 
1 . 1 million of them . 
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival . 
this is , obviously , that famous view now of the arctic , which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years . very , very , very scary . 
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard . 
we started right there , with absolutely nothing . 
the exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people . 
our vice president of operation kissing the board . obviously very , very excited . 
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world . 
and these job losses , we can fix them with green - collar jobs . 
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church . 
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable . 
not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out . 
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink . 
now that can be daunting . 
now my point is the small things matter . 
they are facts about the well - being of conscious creatures . 
now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : this is something that we could be right or wrong about . and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects . 
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind - - neuroscience , psychology , etc . 
but we can ask the obvious question : is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ? 
now , many of you might worry that the notion of well - being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re - construed . 
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : there may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing . 
consider , by analogy , the game of chess . 
but it clearly admits some exceptions . 
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do . 
and yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity . 
how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ? 
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well - being ? 
so , some combustible material there . 
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming - with - rage thing , after as well , some of them . 
language seems to be really important here . 
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face - - i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under . 
paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness . 
so , everything is not going to be up for grabs . 
if you get all those parts aligned , yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love . 
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes . 
so effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything . 
dreadful . thumbs down . 
embarrassing . okay , wonderful , great . 
and a lot of us - - and i suspect , especially a lot of us in this room - - deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students , perfectionists , over - achievers . 
they have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly . 
and for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up . 
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings . 
and something else happened instead . 
and something else happened instead . 
and in order to make it even more exciting , he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun , and he brings out the temple vessels . 
and it had to recognize their different habits , different peoples , different religions , different faiths . 
this is heady national rhetoric , and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return . 
any of you get really freaked out by that ? 
you might want to leave now . 
and he was telling me that really , we ought to try and eradicate these things . 
but part of the reason that i found this interesting is that i started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion , and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living - - that are surviving . 
and in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism . 
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways . 
so bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers . 
right . 
they were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week . 
then , collect your cracked nut in safety . 
and since that time , all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior . 
now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off . 
so , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot . 
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way . 
and many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions . 
so here is the bottom line . 
now here is the net out of this . 
in fact it would be basically nil . 
incidentally , they did pull it off . 
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers . 
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair - - so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors - - so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system . 
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality . 
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance . 
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations - - the hummingbird hawk - moth is beautiful in its adaptation . 
these are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it , the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with . 
so it probably even feels good for the insect , as well as looking good . 
at night they get covered in pollen , which showers down over them , and then the bristles that we saw above , they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out , covered in pollen - - fabulous thing . 
that sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long . 
this thing does something else which is unusual . 
and they get inside , and they get it all on . 
and the plant showers them with pollen , and off they go and pollinate . 
this is what it looks like if you take out the red . 
same with planning . somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution ? 
now , at the end , nonviolent discipline , and this is probably the game - changer . 
now let me move to another place . 
we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used . 
of course , you could bet they have done the most stupid thing : they arrested the barrel . and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car , that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have . 
it can put the price tag of state - sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters . 
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents - - a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified . 
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations , it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do . 
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation . 
so the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future . 
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ? 
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations . 
you need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible . 
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years . 
so my argument today is basically this . 
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors . 
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth . 
and none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her . 
there is nothing wrong with your brain . there is nothing wrong with your mind . 
i work in old - age homes , largely . 
about 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations . 
and about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations . 
a lot of them had to do with a car . 
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned . 
and , above all , she would see cartoons . 
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visually impaired people get these . 
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully . 
well , yeah , a lot of them . 
but they stop there . 
there , the animal finds a mine . 
the value of nothing : out of nothing comes something . 
and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time i was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different . 
because all i could really do was represent in a very one - on - one way . 
and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book . 
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma . 
that figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age . 
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure . 
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it . 
there was a reason for everything . 
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ? 
how do i , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ? 
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life . 
and they all operate at the same time . 
there is also a big question of ambiguity . 
and ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and i have it . moral ambiguity . 
and they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed . 
and all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response . 
do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it ? 
and then , in a way , i knew that they had always been there . 
and what i need , in effect , is a focus . 
and you are noticing it more often . 
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions . 
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of . 
we come to this point and say , what do i as an individual do ? 
also , i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide . 
it seems so obvious , and yet it is not . 
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know . 
there are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book . 
and i needed to find something historically that would match that . 
you wonder , are these things random chance ? 
a big thing that i also think about is accidents . 
and so i was there on three occasions , different seasons . 
and i began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . and i saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility . 
i have to think of my role . where i am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something i came up with ? 
so , there are never complete answers . 
because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling . 
there she is . 
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format . 
and mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of . 
but like most things in technology and the technology world , hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil . 
hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity . 
the underground railroad was a brilliant hack . 
so keep that in mind . 
now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content . 
i authored this answer , and a few others . 
so when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting , cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government . 
so this was just for the handful of legislators in the house . 
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind - - the images that these thoughts created - - and the action that derived from it . 
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness . 
i needed something that would pull me out of all this . 
i needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that i could go from there . 
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ? 
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ? 
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have . 
so i would drag myself into my dance studio - - body , mind and spirit - - every day into my dance studio , and learn everything i learned when i was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped . 
difficult . 
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , i brought laser - sharp focus into my dance , laser - sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery . 
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist . 
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule . 
as i ride out , as i ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , i want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror . 
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do . 
in fact , i have got qualifications . 
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing . 
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually . 
yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality . 
we will observe this day . 
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least . 
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything . 
and obviously the life - saving is increased , the concepts help . 
norman spack : how i help transgender teens become who they want to be 
i want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you , or if you were delivering , about the person you were delivering . 
now , as a pediatric endocrinologist , i used to be very , very involved , and still somewhat am , in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals , and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex . 
that sometimes shows up in the first decade of life , but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross - gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins . 
but at the time that puberty begins , that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls , 12 to 14 in boys , with breast budding or two to three times increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males , by that particular point , the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings , no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things . 
now this is relatively rare , so i had relatively little personal experience with this , and my experience was more typical only because i had an adolescent practice . 
does this make so - and - so straight ? 
the fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get . 
and they fall apart . 
so this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out , they can have more and more testing , they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them . 
in a crowd . 
they were out there suffering , is where they were . 
they had to homeschool her . 
and yet , she had just begun a male puberty . 
and so here she is at 16 , on the left . 
go figure . 
she has a bit of a form to her . 
so where do we go from here ? 
well , we still have a ways to go in terms of anti - discrimination . 
they cost a fortune . 
this is not that common . 
but the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide , but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society . 
coke is everywhere . 
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing . 
they have this very continuous feedback loop . 
and my answer must at once be , it is no use . 
oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it . 
and i would add a cautionary note here , however . 
in life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and i think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage . 
it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off . 
we then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta . 
happy , away i went . 
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ? 
a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big u . k . charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal . 
it must be rubbish . they binned it . 
and in fact , there are many surgeons in the u . k . 
dead easy to give him respect . 
now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic . 
three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health - and earth - friendly diet . 
seriously . 
they both get it wrong , though . 
now , i know everybody over the age of , like 45 - - their mouths are watering at this point . 
but this may have cut down on housework , but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well . 
not that they were any good , but they were there . 
sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed - - the beginning of the heyday of value - added food , which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it . 
all you do is nuke it . what could be better ? 
and zapped horribly , pathetically . 
can farm - raised salmon be organic , when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet , even if the feed itself is supposedly organic , and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens , swimming in their own filth ? 
we can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so . 
okay , here we go . 
okay , so you smile , frowning . 
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school . 
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around . 
building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand . 
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before . 
could we bring down the lights please ? thank you . 
hey . 
he figured out the system . 
uh oh . 
hey . 
bye - bye . 
so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ 10 , 000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects , i thought they were really well - meaning , but a bit naive . 
we garnered much support along the way . 
why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood ? 
25 percent of us are unemployed . low - income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care . 
poor people are not only still poor ; they are still unhealthy . 
i watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down . 
a national highway construction boom was added to our problems . 
and if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community , that is bad and ugly , how could it not reflect on you ? 
he looked at the demographics . 
you , however , are blessed with the gift of influence . 
what troubled me was that this top - down approach is still around . 
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong . 
just look how many . 
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the western population moved over to here . 
so this is where they are today . 
they are now buying cars . 
so there they are . 
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well - educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those & # 91 ; richer also & # 93 ; have . 
but there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying - - there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle . 
and if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology - - so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap - - then they will move all the way up here . 
well , here population & # 91 ; growth & # 93 ; comes in because there & # 91 ; among emerging economies & # 93 ; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end . 
so these & # 91 ; poorest & # 93 ; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion . 
because we already have this & # 91 ; growth & # 93 ; in process . 
but if , and only if , & # 91 ; the poorest & # 93 ; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come & # 91 ; to live & # 93 ; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 . 
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here - - high child - survival , small families - - and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival . 
it can be done . 
this will not happen & # 91 ; again & # 93 ; . 
it was venerable . 
it was ubiquitous . 
well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles . 
how about this week ? 
now , how about your household energy use ? 
anybody check that today ? 
a few energy geeks spread out across the room . 
so what does this tell us ? 
in fact , it already is . 
we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar - sized homes . 
they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it . 
we did everything that letter told us to do , and still i know there must be more . 
thank you . 
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self - stimulatory movements that led them nowhere . 
extremely , extremely isolated . 
now , what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further . 
there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school , you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them , to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly , relentlessly , but often in an awkward fashion , without that immediate resonance . 
well , this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time . 
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat , i can tell you , and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition . 
and we actually have a bit of a question here , because if there are so many different causes of autism , how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome ? because people like myself , when we walk into a playroom , we recognize a child as having autism . 
autism creates itself . 
we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with . 
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory , but in order for us to do that , we had to create these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , how little babies , how newborns , engage with the world , moment by moment , what is important , and what is not . 
well , we created those measures , and here , what you see is what we call a funnel of attention . 
in this scan pass , in green here , are two - year - olds with autism . 
it happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed , and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers . 
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation . 
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40 , 000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life . 
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications . 
this is a real thing . 
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40 , 000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life . 
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications . 
this is a real thing . 
perhaps a stealth thing . 
there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible . 
so fingers crossed . 
and sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity . 
i just become skanky . 
so there you are . 
no fighting , ladies . 
and then i just threw some typography on it . 
seriously . 
yes . it can , it does and it will , but for this book designer , page - turner , dog - eared place - holder , notes in the margins - taker , ink - sniffer , the story looks like this . 
and it is . 
i suffered a lot as a mother . 
you have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous . 
you must be tolerant . 
so really , any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian . 
i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution . 
on the weekend , your choice . 
so you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish . 
this is the forensic anthropology research facility , and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition . 
they carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations , and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability . 
and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment . 
they flip the negative . 
it runs 24 hours a day , commercial free . 
he is photographed at his alibi location . 
now the brain may not look like much from the outside - - a couple pounds of pinkish - gray flesh , amorphous - - but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within . 
now in the 20th century , there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders , and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders , practically none of them can be considered to be cured . 
so when i started in neuroscience 11 years ago , i had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist , and the first thing i thought about was , if these neurons are electrical devices , all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance . 
so this turned out to be very simple to do . 
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability . 
instead of one point in the brain , we can devise devices that span the brain , that can deliver light into three - dimensional patterns - - arrays of optical fibers , each coupled to its own independent miniature light source . 
this tone used to mean bad news . 
now i want to close on one story , which we think is another possibility - - which is that maybe these molecules , if you can do ultra - precise control , can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic , an optical prosthetic . 
the photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top , and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom , the ganglion cells , relay the information to the brain , where we see that as perception . 
now how could you repair this ? 
now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute - force search . 
and our hope is that , by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them , we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier , practically none of which are cured , and in the 21st century make them history . 
right , yeah . 
also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider . 
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board , there is a lot of force , a lot of power . 
if i put some tension on my body , tension on my suit , i can make it fly . and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface . 
of being in free fall , with all the visual references . 
the special thing on these three jumps were , i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day . 
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge . 
i think we all might have some questions . 
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ? 
all right . well we will watch this space . but i have two more questions . 
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards . 
people would yell at me from their passing cars . 
it was consistent . 
so after all of our shows , we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people , and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us , and i would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows , and they would pass the hat , and then they would come in and join us onstage , so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird , random circus guests . 
this is this . 
i maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing . 
it felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat . 
and what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone . 
you take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result . 
a real - world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result . 
what the hell ? 
all countries spy . 
so once again , we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose , making all of us less secure as an outcome . 
and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the e . u . conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ? 
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the united states . 
how do you do that ? 
the solution is open source . 
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear . 
so i got inspired by that . 
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them . 
the lower level employees thought it was very funny . 
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags . 
in my previous life , i was an artist . 
there was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident , or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star . 
the french e . u . official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting . 
and when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people . 
one day i remember walking along a street that had just been colored , and where we were in the process of planting trees , when i saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop . 
crime did fall . 
the paint on the walls did not feed children , nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant , but it gave hope and light , and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things , a different spirit , a different feel to our lives , and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics , we could build a better life for each other and for our country . 
by means of open competitions , we managed to recruit in our administration many young people , and we thus managed to build a de - politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented . 
can i ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something - - a movie , an album , a song or a book - - and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ? 
and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u . s . today . 
they lack retention ; you find yourself re - explaining concepts three months later , wholesale . 
you expect sitcom - sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track . 
so 90 percent of what i do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving . 
and because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it . 
and that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , i teach kids - - because of my inexperience - - i teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ? 
but here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition . 
it has not had the impact that these other companies have had . 
those colorful , out - of - the - box kind of thinkers . 
right ? i mean , the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum , or something . 
what actually makes your phone a smartphone , basically , instead of a stupid phone ? 
so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs , whereas the slight variations of existing drugs - - viagra , different color , different dosage - - are the less revolutionary ones . 
it was even , god forbid , being a venture capitalist . 
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations . 
but perhaps even more important , we heard before about the one percent , the 99 percent . 
so whatever it was , it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way . 
the area near these walls , which nobody bothers to pay attention to , had been left free from major intervention , and this is where i first found my treasures . 
when i went on school field trips , family vacations , or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes , i wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked inside my school bag . 
through bowmaking , i came in contact with part of my heritage . 
no , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind . 
erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog . 
but even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . you know ? 
they use it synecdochically . 
and i absolutely love the periodic table . 
and this is pretty easy biotechnology . 
the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery . 
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward . 
so this is a virus - based solar cell . 
but i actually walked away with a great job offer . 
and there was a little - - an interesting theory about abstraction . 
i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins . 
come back down , you weigh twice as much . 
you do it again and again . 
we set up a whole er . 
once he was there , & # 91 ; we & # 93 ; let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like . 
so we did a second parabola . 
i took off my yarmulke , because i had no medical equipment , and with a lot of pressure , i stopped his bleeding . 
now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly . 
there are just way too few eye care professionals . 
how do you distribute ? how do you work out how to fit the thing ? 
how do you deal with the industry ? 
let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground . 
the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit . 
i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today . 
the way the tv - industrial complex works , is you buy some ads - - interrupt some people - - that gets you distribution . 
well , this tv - industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours . 
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way . 
they would ignore the geeks , and god forbid , the laggards . 
they got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable . 
a couple of quick rules to wrap up . 
for the people who were there and looking at that section , it was remarkable . 
because he did something that was at the fringes . 
so what you need to do is figure out who does care . 
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us . 
other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling . 
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly . 
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor - - equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you . 
but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well - being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability . 
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ? 
the people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them . 
there is the idea of hitting the wall , that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse . 
people have a huge amount of fun doing this , reconnecting with other people as they do it . 
there was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy . 
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff . 
another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan , which is basically to develop a plan b for the town . 
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions . 
and by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the oil age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other . 
for once , your incentives are aligned . 
in most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries . 
it varies a bit province to province . 
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges . 
has about one - third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of . 
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one - in - three chance of developing diabetes . 
it no longer just makes sense . 
it turns out , all sorts of things . 
now , during the boom , there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density , a sort of compact , walkable urban neighborhoods . 
plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped . 
transit is a big driver of retrofits . 
this was a very large mall on a hundred - acre superblock . 
here was the mall in its heyday . 
they had their prom in the mall . they loved their mall . 
but densification is not going to work everywhere . 
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit . 
we need to be able to target which areas really should be re - greened . 
they are new but trying to look old . 
the fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks , the streets and blocks , the putting in of public space , compromised as it may be , is still a really great thing . 
but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to . 
so often the men are gone . 
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care . 
they go shopping for all sorts of things . 
the more attractive she finds him , the more sex they have ; the more sex they have , the nicer he is to her ; the nicer he is to her , the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed - - and ultimately , they live happily ever after . 
in other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department . 
yeah . 
and he kind of nodded , you know ? 
and that always stuck with me all my life . 
you see this little pattern here ? 
you feel for them . 
ten variations . this is , like , spin the letter around . 
how many coffees do you have ? 
what is the tenor of their email ? how is it working out ? 
we have a big problem . 
then we were victims of the french . 
hold on ! wait a minute ! 
the problem is not the things we feel victims of . 
the first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy . 
daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances . 
less safe ! 
i will follow the instructions , the tempo markings , the dynamics . 
snares on , snares off . 
and so on . my career would probably last about five years . 
and i just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum . 
not just translate them , but interpret them . 
and so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums - - in particular , the kettle drums , or tympani - - to such a narrow pitch interval , so something like . . . 
that of a difference . then gradually . . . and gradually . . . 
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs - - they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand . 
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry . 
so it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work . 
so to find an actual hall is incredible - - for which you can play exactly what you imagine , without it being cosmetically enhanced . 
it may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . that , to them , means they can walk . 
and please try to create that through your clapping . try . just - - please try . 
rain . not bad . not bad . 
turned it upside down , experimented with the shell , experimented with the head . 
experimented with my body , experimented with jewelry , experimented with all sorts of things . 
and of course , i returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that - - but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ? 
so we never , ever dealt with actual study books . 
and by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people . 
and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout . 
of those 85 takes , only three actually successfully completed their run . 
and we learned that small stuff stinks . 
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust , and they fall out of the tracks , the exact angles makes it hard to get right . 
but as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go . 
thank you very much . 
let me start again . 
dogs . 
is there more energy coming in than going out ? 
if so , more warming is in the pipeline . 
but that lag is exactly what is expected . 
the physics does not change . 
what sea level rise can we look forward to ? 
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business - as - usual fossil fuel use . 
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate , giving talks in 10 countries , getting arrested , burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over 30 years ? 
more grandchildren helped me along . 
so now you know what i know that is moving me to sound this alarm . 
thank you . 
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf . 
do you have a need for speed ? 
an olive server . 
some type of extension pole - - like what the painters use . 
shape - retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . contrast that with a plastic garbage can - - and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back . 
and he kind of comically explained that time after time , what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ; if there were no dead policemen , it was ok to go . 
in what i call the flushed - and - plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke . 
there is now a new career path called stool donor . 
i tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings i liked or not . 
and i put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on . 
i got into fish . 
and after i got - - i was really drunk - - i was asked to do some sketches on napkins . 
the thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat . 
so . . . 
toxic waste , i guess , is the key clue to that one . 
it was a joke . 
the whole thing about my house , the whole use of rough carpentry and everything , was the frustration with the crafts available . 
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle . 
instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 . 
the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building . 
i just joined the points . 
i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that . 
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it . 
i keep trying to make it work . 
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries . 
i locked the house into the site by cutting the back end - - here you see on the photographs of the site - - slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall , creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom , which i designed like a kind of a barge , looking like a boat . 
and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table . 
kind of a fun thing to do . 
and i struggled with that thing - - how to get around the corner . 
and so it will be quite a different shape . 
but this is how i do work . i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away . 
sometimes school is under a tree , or in many cases , the teacher has only a fifth - grade education , so you need a collaborative model of learning , not just building more schools and training more teachers , which you have to do anyway . 
affirmative action is not very popular frankly , with white voters , period . 
i can , however , give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have . 
or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder . 
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease . 
it did not evolve for natural survival . 
now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction . 
the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water in a bluish distance , indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally - - get this - - a path or a road , perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline , that extends into the distance , almost inviting you to follow it . 
they go back about two - and - a - half - million years . 
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship . 
but still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances . 
now you say , really ? 
they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency , but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence , no longer a dependence upon the people alone , increasingly a dependence upon the funders . 
it blocks the right too , as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible . 
because there is an economy here , an economy of influence , an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization . 
it feeds on dysfunction . 
okay , now , every single one of you knows this . 
you focus on the possible problems , like eradicating polio from the world , or taking an image of every single street across the globe , or building the first real universal translator , or building a fusion factory in your garage . 
and not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption . 
yours is the most important issue , but mine is the first issue , the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about . 
no sensible reform , and we cannot afford a world , a future , with no sensible reform . 
now i get this skepticism . 
change the incentives , and the behavior changes , and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice . 
do you have that love ? 
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand . 
and the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow , and when they die , their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand , things like coral and so forth . 
so sort of left - eye view , right - eye view . 
okay . 
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing . 
and these are flytrap anemones . 
it produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense . 
but if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue . 
so this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark . 
injury crashes have dropped 76 percent , fatal crashes down 90 percent . 
but the other two are somewhat questionable . 
can that be accomplished with existing signs ? 
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs . 
that would not work . 
so , i was able to completely daydream my way through my life . 
and so what happened was that i started just becoming an editorial illustrator through , you know , sheer whatever , sheer ignorance . 
and i - - and my full - time job , i landed the best job on earth , was to daydream , and to actually come up with absurd ideas that - - fortunately , there were enough people there , and it was a team , it was a collective , it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas . 
you have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually . 
so , i get to put in all of the things that i love . 
too many pogroms . 
facts were actually banished from our home . 
well , not so awful . 
or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying ? 
this is what that looked like . 
the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question . 
you know the sawing - the - lady - in - half trick ? 
yes . 
everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? ok . 
this is change - blindness . 
no trouble there . 
can everybody see ? all right . 
audience : yes . 
it was incredibly successful . 
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes . 
that will not succeed . 
nobody has claimed credit for that . 
there is no plan b right now . 
in some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery . 
and they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement . 
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement . 
by measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution . 
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity - led science and exploration . 
that funds everything in the u . k . 
is there any other use to exploration and science , other than just a sense of wonder ? 
and it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas . 
the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam . 
he was clearly under assault all the time . 
it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold . 
and even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole . 
but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang . 
are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ? 
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there . 
so then it was my turn , and somehow , i get myself onto the stage , i start my song , i open my mouth to sing the first line , and this completely horrible vibrato - - you know , when your voice wavers - - comes streaming out . 
and something good did happen - - i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for . 
and then i could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease . 
would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you ? 
so what do artists do ? well , what artists do is to measure . 
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious . . . 
and bingo . that is all you have to do . 
and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science . 
but the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out . 
no matter what the shapes were , the growth law is the same . 
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first - order discrete differential equation and a second - order discrete differential equation , derived by six - year - olds . 
and i can try steering the car here by . . . 
see the car turn by five here ? 
so what if i click this down to zero ? 
student 1 : ooh , this is nice . 
teacher : drop . class : whoa ! 
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase . 
now , what if we want to look at this more closely ? 
and how shall we look and verify that we actually have it ? 
they take you to gruff - ex - cop - on - his - fourth - marriage . dad . 
my train was a heart attack . 
because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this . 
okay , i spent 25 years , in my middle - age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that . 
it was insidious and it was really happening . 
well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here . 
oh , not so lucky . 
this might be what we end up with . 
or i could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company . 
now , we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle - - the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices , the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing , and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors . 
except maybe french people . 
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment . 
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other . 
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life . 
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway . 
they are not meant to stay . 
so the reactions in the street were kind of interesting . 
and the army took them , and instead of bringing them to the police station , they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces . 
we kept traveling . 
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor . 
so the people kept it . 
but they asked me for a promise basically . 
so we start by brewing the tea . 
so this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing . 
and this is a static culture . 
using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning . 
it was an astronomy book , and i poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft . 
these are a number of our science space earth orbiters . 
all right , so what about the rest of it ? 
you can manipulate it yourself . 
we cannot get medicine to them reliably , they cannot get critical supplies , and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income . 
imagine this scenario . 
what would you do today ? 
well , you would place a request via mobile phone , and someone would get the request immediately . 
and the third is the operating system that manages the whole network . 
these fly autonomously . 
every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism , so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations , they dock , swap a battery automatically , and go out again . 
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network . 
it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions , avoid other risk factors , and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network . 
well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars . 
what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests , astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees , voodoo dolls , fireflies , chocolate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball , it would be as smooth as a billiard ball , presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle . 
and so this starting material is back to the basic building block . 
so we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there . 
so as you see the film go in transparently through there , and then . . . 
and then you go a little crazy , and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays , like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes . 
or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make . 
so you think of alternative mechanical parts . 
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted . 
and so what you see there is the difference . 
the hypothalamus , the part of the brain that regulates body weight , there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight , more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it , and the system works like a thermostat , responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger , activity and metabolism , to keep your weight stable as conditions change . 
several long - term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders . 
it takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project , and because willpower is limited , any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else . 
and so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device . 
say a new super bug has emerged . 
and this was the big story of the day at that time . 
they enter the queue , they just zip right out . 
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there . 
so that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment . 
and this is just the same . 
just have a look at the demographics in the u . s . here . 
in 2010 , two workers per retiree in the u . s . 
there are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging . 
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention . 
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body . 
so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound - healing mechanisms . 
and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself . 
could you regenerate a limb ? 
this is clinically relevant today . 
he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish . 
this was a randomized trial . 
these are now two years out . 
there go the cells . 
so you could go in , you could get your tummy - tuck . 
this is equally tragic . 
everything that is done to treat burn - - basically we do a sodding approach . 
we make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take . 
so my 18 minutes is up . 
clearly the images kind of get that across . 
and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along . 
but there were problems . 
how did look at the stuff in your life ? 
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered . 
so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ? 
and they even have different colors . 
plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range . 
now while this may be the low - economic - cost solution , this is certainly not the low - environmental or human health - and - safety solution . 
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way . 
so about 20 years ago , i literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world . 
and we eventually broke the code . 
we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment . 
in the short time period i have , i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this . 
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately . 
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi - step separation process begins . 
we push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti - like plastic strands . 
so now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home . 
we took our clues from mother nature . 
the u . n . wanted to rush people and supplies to the area . 
but help was coming . 
and it took them four days . 
in fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking - - some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth . 
none of them are taught in cooking schools . 
and the hope was two - fold . 
but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical , maybe a little bit more scientific , maybe a little bit more chef - y than they otherwise would have . 
and one of our canning cutaways . 
in most cases , though , there was no glass . 
like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue . 
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it . 
the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it . 
now this was revolutionary . 
the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static . 
here it is . 
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small . 
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory . 
now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one - by - one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe . 
the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes . 
i suspect the latter . 
it appears that it may not always be that way . 
how do you think of where cosmology is now , in a sort of historical side ? 
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ? 
and i thought , go figure . 
now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move , but a composer is considering all possible moves , testing them out , prioritizing them out , until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness . 
he came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this . 
and i thought , my god , how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed , across the room to recover the memory of this music that , after everything else in his life is sloughing away , still means so much to him ? 
maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results . 
even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation , less rigorous ethical reviews , and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure . 
the first of these is informed consent . 
if you are a researcher , i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience , to remain ethical in your research , and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers . 
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves . 
most old people in the u . s . end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends . 
at the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people . 
whatever food is available has to be reserved for able - bodied adults and for children . 
they are fed . they remain valuable . 
one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food . 
another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren . 
cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the u . s . 
there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u . s . 
changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past . 
yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce , carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self - esteem associated with work . 
the slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old , but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later . 
what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u . s . , and to make better use of their value ? 
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high - quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full - time caretakers of their children . 
a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology . 
at the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back . 
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back . 
paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before . 
the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom - - a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies , clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots , leaving clean compost . 
first , a burial suit infused with mushroom spores , the mushroom death suit . 
and at last , we appear to be doing something about it . 
in the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it . 
she , better than most , knew the power of an image . 
and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something . 
and that question cleared the space . 
and i have that kind of flash sometimes . 
now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like . 
and she was next door to a very wealthy , oil - rich neighbor . 
had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it . 
she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game . 
so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat . 
by the third sentence , she was in tears . 
i was in tears . 
and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding . 
if only . 
what would it be like to be improving the human lot ? 
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck . 
more is bad . 
i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing . 
in the u . k . , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do - - never my best thing . 
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important - - learning throughout the whole life course . 
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people . 
now , he was a preacher , but i believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the promised land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want . 
well , it has its pluses and minuses . 
that is our regime , our government - - our atrocious government , & # 91 ; that & # 93 ; has done every crime in order to stay in power . 
we pose a threat to the order of the government . 
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse - - the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty . 
now i am making films . 
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art - - to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art . 
how to move you with your emotions , but also make your mind work . 
so , we have two panels here , of colored dots . 
and you have to tell me which one . 
here is the green one . 
so , if i could have the lights down up here . 
can i have the lights up again ? 
and yet there is still one on a dark surround and one on a light surround . 
why ? because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective - - just the laws of physics . 
and here she comes down the ladder . 
he finds it . amazing . right ? 
and now , when i tell people what i do , they move toward me . 
and the third problem about the disease model is , in our rush to do something about people in trouble , in our rush to do something about repairing damage , it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier , positive interventions . 
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage . 
about 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy . 
now obviously she failed . 
but what she did was to take her highest strengths , and re - craft work to use them as much as possible . 
this is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally . 
and meaning , in this view , consists of - - very parallel to eudaimonia - - it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are . 
and what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set . 
and we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ? 
and it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery . 
and there was a drunk man on there , and he got up out of his seat two or three times , and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do . 
i talk ad lib . 
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality . 
was there a god ? 
he put it on a personal basis . 
how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying ? 
or he was insane . 
or he was what he claimed to be . 
which was he ? 
well actually , i hope for a while longer yet . 
and of course , the u . k . benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth . 
after all , the best education - - according to the latest world university rankings - - is to be found in the universities of the u . k . and the u . s . 
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ? 
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species . 
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants . 
our cities , i would put to you , are stockpiles of these surplus capacities . 
we have visions like this . we have visions like this . 
the wisdom lives inside of them . 
and the girls decided to make it an annual event . 
because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives . 
and most of those losses are because of things we know . 
and this flu has wiped through the population of bees . 
but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous . 
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the national guard would be out . 
and you can install this in your hive and replace that dead - out . 
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his veil , which he used as a screening , right in this meadow . and so that ingenuity is inspiring . 
but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees . 
and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined . 
white - nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats . 
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too . 
namaste . good morning . 
i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race . 
where we have now come to live in a world where the most horrific poverty , genocide , mass rapes , the destruction of the earth , is completely out of control . 
so , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening . 
their stories were so horrific , and so mind - blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered . 
my mind was so shattered . 
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened . 
that shattering , that opening of my girl cell , that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous , and braver , and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life . 
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire - building is actually - - that feelings get in the way of empire - building . 
i see how boys have been brought up , and i see this across the planet : to be tough , to be hardened , to distance themselves from their tenderness , to not cry . 
we silence them . we make them feel guilty for being smart . we get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense . 
we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities . 
but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24 , they are they key , really , in the developing world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of humanity . 
the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings , which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers . 
and she was holding her baby . 
she went to school and she found her voice , and she found her identity , and she found her heart . 
then , her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation , after a year . 
in that hut , we walked in , and her father and his four wives were sitting there , and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled , and her primary mother , who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders . 
when her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying . 
there is a particular way of knowing . 
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ? 
can you say it with me ? 
the punch line ? 
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , births , strokes , heart disease , hip replacements , 4 a . m . emergencies . 
a time for inconveniences , mishaps , yearnings . 
for a time that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press - - across a lot of different media from a lot of big names . 
something deliberate , something secret , and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway ? 
hs : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait - - let me see if i got this straight . 
rives : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . 
parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want . 
you could do the whole thing with addition . 
here , we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will , but capable of only two ideas . 
the instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail . 
the essentials were all there - - all the things that make these machines run . 
the machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations . 
this is hackers getting in trouble for the first time . 
the input and the output was by teletype tape at first . 
burning lots of midnight oil . 
he had a wonderful rapport . 
even errors were duplicated . 
it was published in the literature . 
and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike , or a new kind of life . 
so there it is , 50 years later , sitting there - - sort of suspended animation . 
these cards , now , thanks to me showing up , are being saved . 
he was thinking far ahead , to how this would really grow into a new kind of life . 
and we owe a tremendous credit to that . 
this is neat . 
the new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun . 
yeah ! yeah . 
oh well , different story . 
buy it anyway . 
intense fear paralyzes you . 
now some people can - - circus workers , steel workers . 
biology - - we have co - adapted through biology to like bright colors . 
cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it - - saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax . 
the other neat thing . . . 
to get that device just below the tabletop . 
that is actually the device . 
there might be somebody on one right now , participating in multi - dimensional engagement . 
this one i love . 
this is the sound of one hand clapping . 
now , that fascinated me endlessly as a child , but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time . 
but how would you actually go about testing such a theory ? 
over 25 years that has huge long - run effects on the wealth of your nation . 
and most granularly , i break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world - - so an extreme level of granularity . 
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of . 
they simply go through their lives getting on with it . 
they get no great pleasure from what they do . 
that there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are . 
and many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries . 
now , doing this is easier said than done . 
how many of you here are over the age of 25 ? 
ask a room full of teenagers the same thing . 
and the reason is , you see , that we were brought up in a pre - digital culture , those of us over 25 . 
one of them is the idea of linearity : that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right , you will end up set for the rest of your life . 
but , you know , we have become obsessed with this linear narrative . 
i think we are obsessed with getting people to college . 
certain sorts of college . 
this linearity thing is a problem . 
in a way , it did not for me . 
and you cannot predict the outcome of human development . 
and i wanted to just very quickly . . . 
and we should tread softly . 
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms . 
her body was riddled with secondary tumors . 
the next slide is going to be gruesome . 
think about that for a minute . 
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else . 
and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe , you know , in his brain something was stirring , some sort of musical gift . 
now , not being able to see meant , of course , that you taught yourself . 
now then . 
well done . 
two billion people without sanitation . 
and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable . 
we have not had an idea . 
it could be at one dollar ; it could be 1 , 000 dollars . 
they make that in some ways disgusting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ? 
or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ? 
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of & # 91 ; million & # 93 ; people get infected every year . 
that would be the second best investment that we could do . 
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate . 
i find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that . 
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good . 
do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich dutch guy ? 
so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight . 
so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities . 
i should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ? 
they all come out with very much the same list . 
and that gives me great hope , really , in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ? 
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to . 
each one of those lives matters a lot . 
so we really can make changes . 
so it was absolutely gigantic . 
and two tools helped bring the death rate down . 
and rich men are afflicted . 
but , malaria - - even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact . 
and so you end up with two choices . 
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication . 
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things . 
it involves communicators to keep the funding high , to keep the visibility high , to tell the success stories . 
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise . 
we need rich - world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things . 
there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places . 
and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you measure them against the other top 20 percent . 
now , the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis , but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting . 
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year . 
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this . 
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing . 
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile - - the very best - - and the bottom quartile . 
because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension . 
the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system . 
the teacher was running around , and the energy level was high . 
and i thought it was so fantastic . 
i will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum . 
i know intimately that skin you are hitting . 
i will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing . 
life is a right , not collateral or casual . 
gather my beloved near , and our chanting will be dancing . 
our humming will be drumming . 
i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat . 
a bunch of pacifists . 
confused , aspiring pacifists . 
all holy history banned . 
whose son shall it be ? 
we cherish corpses . 
we mourn women , complicated . 
profits made , prophets ignored . 
war and tooth , enameled salted lemon childhoods . 
rhythm is half silence . 
i see now , i never was one and not the other . 
i think now i never was pure . 
human contracted itself blind , malignant . 
i never was pure . 
girl spoiled before ripened . 
i experience exponentially . 
cluster bombs left behind . 
de facto landmines . 
harvest contaminated tobacco . 
harvest bombs . 
harvest baby teeth . 
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights . 
it makes you a little nauseous . 
one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure . 
so now , how is that ? 
that very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness . 
there are some which are adverse to this well - being . 
just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature . 
all the nominal connections , in numbers and quantities , were thought - - until the last 20 years - - thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age . 
if you see a comic movie , you go off to the left side . 
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever . 
and jumping monks of tibet . 
let me show you what it looks like . 
for instance , what if i could use this data to find out how relaxed i am at any moment ? 
if you nod off , the system would know , dimming to darkness as you do . 
that you could know something about yourself . 
perhaps even more importantly , thought - controlled computing can give children with add insights into their own fluctuating mental states , so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs . 
but they understood something more fundamental - - the sheer joy in discovery , the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it , the richness that we get from seeing , feeling and knowing the lives that we are . 
so where does this lead ? 
by buying a space that was 420 sq . ft . 
first of all , you have to edit ruthlessly . 
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers . 
the course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset . 
but i want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per month , in india and china , when will that have reached that of u . k . and the united states ? 
those are nice words . but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom . 
but really , really natural sovereignty was good for japan . 
and the second world war was really a terrible event , also economically for japan . 
what happens in the after independence ? 
there they are today . 
if you have a lot inequity , macro - geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living . 
whereas u . k . and united states is getting richer and richer . 
and after second world war , united states is richer than u . k . 
look at , look at the united states . 
you see it came down there . 
they seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know . 
you see , japan did it like that . 
can you see here what japan did ? 
japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high - income economies . 
but the real projections for those ones , i would like to give it like this . 
inequalities in china and india i consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population . 
this is a thousand - year - old drawing of the brain . 
because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell , that cell will glow green - - or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein , you get a cell to glow many different colors . 
and instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch , there were these ready - made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all . 
now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone , but they are even more surprised when i tell them how affordable these components are . 
now these models are not just visually appealing , but they are also geometrically accurate , which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees , calculate surface area , the volume of vegetation , and so on , all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests . 
medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer , and the problem is , as we age , our organs tend to fail more , and so currently there are not enough organs to go around . 
so this is now a public health crisis . 
or we can use both . 
and that really has to do to many different challenges . 
but if i were to point to three challenges , the first one is actually the design of materials that could go in your body and do well over time . 
and many advances now , we can do that fairly readily . 
you saw the spray going in . 
that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure , this tubularized structure , which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so . 
so they know what to do . 
we then tease the cells apart , we grow the cells outside the body . 
we then take a scaffold , a biomaterial - - again , looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt - - we then shape that material , and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time - - very much like baking a layer cake , if you will . 
we then put it in this oven - like device . 
and we then can re - perfuse the liver with cells , preserving the blood vessel tree . 
and we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology . 
and this is actually new technology still under development . 
so this is more challenging - - large organ , vascular , a lot of blood vessel supply , a lot of cells present . 
we then are able to actually image those , do 360 degree rotation to analyze the kidney in its full volumetric characteristics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing computerized form . 
so we go layer by layer through the organ , analyzing each layer as we go through the organ , and we then are able to send that information , as you see here , through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient . 
this actually shows the actual printer . 
and this actually shows that printing . 
put a pair of gloves here . 
has a little bit of consistency to it . 
this is actually the printer that you see here onstage . 
i was missing school . it was pretty much miserable . 
i felt so sick . 
i went through about 16 surgeries , and it seemed impossible to do that when i was in kidney failure when i was 10 . 
are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work ? 
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other . 
so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that . 
and if you put them together in different combinations - - just like printing in a sense , like how a magazine color is printed - - and put them under certain forces , which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them , these amazing things started appearing . 
and they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open . 
there are lines in front of the one on the right , and there are lines behind the one on the left , and so it takes it into different planes . 
like the occurrence of moire patterns . 
it just has so much in it . 
we traveled the country . 
in 1973 , i made my first trip to china . 
there were hardly any cars . 
and with it , comes congestion , and we lose mobility , and so on and so forth . 
could we make it more affordable ? 
we came up with a number of models : economy models , cheaper to build and more compact ; membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens . 
and most important , permeable , open . 
and i want to touch on one more issue , which is the design of the public realm . 
good morning . 
but no faces ? 
his contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here - - en face or three - quarters . 
well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three - quarters . 
so we can eliminate all the profiles . 
so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized . 
so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures . 
and look what happens - - only three candidates remain that fit the bill . 
but there are 1 , 100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces . 
and hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well - developed chin . 
the young man should be made first . 
and as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case . 
yes , it does . he was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made . 
well , we need a reference . 
and before i knew it , i was involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me . 
we have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks - and - mortar place for all of our care , because these places are often the wrong tool , and the most expensive tool , for the job . 
and i have these palpitations that are showing up . 
and i tell you , this kind of care customization for everything from your goals to your genetics will be the most game - changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime . 
it flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall . 
what you see over here , this is what we want to do next . 
what you see over here , this yellow thing , this is not a death ray . 
we are literally re - inventing the wheel here . 
so , it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things . 
and also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine . 
so , this is some of the early feasibility experiments . 
we do something to something and just like magic , it moves . the blob . 
the best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype . 
this was in 2004 ; at that time , this was something really , really revolutionary . 
so , really , we have five secrets . 
and so , 4 am in the morning , what do you expect , right ? 
so , we gather around , we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it . 
so , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up . 
well , actually , there are two sides to the story . 
so , there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition . 
this picture in the back this is 3 a . m . in the morning . 
now , 1986 . 
so there is some sort of justice in the world after all . 
same thing with every single password and so on . 
you just have to believe me , it is , it is . 
but just keep staring at it . 
well in most cases it never gets this far . 
and this really is something which creates completely new problems for us . 
what we need is more global , international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs - - these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks . 
we have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity . 
and he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky , and where you can experience the sun , that give us a better life in the built environment , just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows . 
what it all boils down to is , of course , the sun . 
they created this shade that you can see here , which actually covers the sun , but opens up to the good light from the sky . 
and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quantitative , as well as qualitative , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture . 
this is , i think , a very illustrative image of what i try to say - - that the beautiful dynamics of sun , bringing these into the building , creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives . 
it has only on one side this big , big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range . 
so it can be very dim over there , and you do your work , and it can be very bright over there , and you do your work . 
but actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull , and therefore helps us to enhance our lives . 
i really owe a short introduction of this man to you . 
and it is all about this planet . 
but when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this . 
it never reaches the ground where it was meant for . 
it never is to the benefit of people . 
how do we tackle things like mobility ? 
and i will very quickly show you how it works . 
so just to explain . 
we can go further . 
and i will very quickly show you how it works . 
so just to explain . 
we can go further . 
even in the oceans , we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well - being . 
i think , when i see it , i start to think , who are those people ? 
so i give you this wonderful , informative image of the sky , ranging from the inner city , where you may see one or two stars and nothing else , all the way to the rural environments , where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars . 
thank you very much . 
so this takes care of my age . 
so how can you , without drying up , make things with the same pleasure , as a gift to others , for so long ? 
after that , it had to be kneaded . it had to then go in , kind of , a mangle . 
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory . 
and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on . 
they just grow and divide , and grow and divide - - so a kind of boring life , except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters . 
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life . 
but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well . 
the question we had is how could they do anything at all ? 
what was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light , but when the bacteria made light . 
why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous , glow - in - the - dark bacterium that lives in the ocean - - all bacteria have systems like this . 
they vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote . 
what they do , we now understand , is they get in you , they wait , they start growing , they count themselves with these little molecules , and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together , they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host . 
we also then went to look at what are these molecules - - these were the red triangles on my slides before . 
what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages . 
so these are private , secret conversations . 
then again we turn to chemistry , and we figured out what this generic molecule is - - that was the pink ovals on my last slide , this is it . 
but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well . 
by targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species - specific , or disease - specific , anti - quorum sensing molecules . 
what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium - - a multi - drug - resistant pathogenic bacterium - - in the same time we give our anti - quorum sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives . 
i hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works - - i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child . 
thanks . 
so , create . so what are some of the people that are using these kind of tools ? 
tremendous , tremendous use . 
what about copying , reusing , right ? 
this costs , anybody guess ? 
ok , so what are the enablers ? 
even the three wise men . 
behind that is the legal code , so if you want to very carefully construct it , and creative commons is taking off - - over 43 million things out there , licensed with a creative commons license . 
so i did some research . 
and i found that there was an historic precedence . 
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now . 
there were definitely hang - out spots . 
but some were for working , some were for playing , some were for guys to collect their things . 
it has no nails or screws . 
but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional - size boxing ring inside . 
and so there is a good reason for this . 
so , as i came to the end of my journey , i found over 50 spaces . 
and they were unexpected and they were surprising . 
but they were also - - i was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them . 
so the bandstand , as we call it , this is an incredible space . 
you really are alive right here in this moment . 
see , these are all right inside of the color palette . 
the texture changed in the drums this time . 
it got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it . 
you have some people who do . 
but what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities . 
ready , just play some time . 
and just as everybody got excited about it , bang ! 
and he thought about it , and he went to his deep freezer , minus 20 degrees centigrade , and he poured through everything in the freezer , and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs . 
this was very exciting , but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work , because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it , cryoprotectants , to look after it when it was frozen . 
what we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation . 
and then again . and pretty soon , we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those . 
and crocodiles were not behaving at that time either . 
but what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines . 
climate change has affected the world for a long period of time , and gradually , the forests disappeared , the country began to dry out , and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline , until by five million years ago , only one left . 
that was not what happened , actually . 
have a look at this bit of film footage . 
does it have to stay this way ? 
the guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup and they pickled it in alcohol . 
i put a team together . 
so we got it . 
critics of this project say , hang on . 
they give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean . 
you know , some kind of weird hybrid chimera ? 
he led them around on a rope . 
at any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remembered , was the hut , and tears came into his eyes . 
and he told me , as it all was flooding back in memories . 
the grasslands were sweeping away . 
and the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around . 
some of the thylacines that were being turned into zoos , sanctuaries , even at the museums , had collar marks on the neck . 
the issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent . 
before going further , let me give you a crash course in plant biology . 
only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant . eighty - five percent is lost . 
eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost . 
basically , we get it out of mines . 
what you are seeing here is an open - pit mine in the u . s . , and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine , if you look in the top right - hand corner , the little crane you can see , that is a giant crane . 
so that really puts it into perspective . 
this graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today . 
do we have a solution ? 
the plant is only able to seek out soluble forms . 
the mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use . 
mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other . 
mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years , and it has even helped modern - day plant species to diversify . 
to the first son , he left half the camels . 
you get 17 . 
well what i learned is whenever tempers rise in those communities , someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush , and then everyone sits around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk . 
well that system is , i think , probably the system that kept us alive to this point , given our human tendencies . 
the conversation got back on track . 
stories matter . as an anthropologist , i know that . 
and what he stood for was unity , the unity of the family . 
we did our due diligence . 
only she became pregnant all the same . 
they are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities , even their appearance . 
couples who are looking for greater happiness , greater sexual happiness in their married lives , but are at a loss of how to achieve it , especially wives , who are afraid of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom . 
the right to express our ideas freely , to marry whom we choose , to choose our own partners , to be sexually active or not , to decide whether to have children and when , all this without violence or force or discrimination . 
but at this critical moment in history , if we do not anchor freedom and justice , dignity and equality , privacy and autonomy in our personal lives , in our sexual lives , we will find it very hard to achieve in public life . 
are they a potential mate ? are they a potential networking opportunity ? 
we do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them . 
the boxes are too narrow . 
i mean , who knows , right ? 
in fact , no one in my life knew that i was a girl - - not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that i worked with . 
i felt like i was performing this elaborate act . 
and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that i was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character . 
it might give them pause . 
we are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded . 
visibility really is key . 
in fact , on the contrary , it highlights them . 
and i watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me . 
of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced . 
the most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : if you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between . 
and the reality that this presents is a complicated one . 
is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ? 
so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ? 
am i the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ? 
thank you . 
so this was the thinking back then , and these individuals made these holes . 
sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because , you can tell that the holes are made partially and then , i think , there was some trepanation , and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole , and we know they survived these procedures . 
and when things work well , then the nervous system works well , and everything functions . 
and this works like that , instantly . 
and the difference between shaking in this way and not - - the difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of 25 , 000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus . 
there are eight children in the family . 
five of them have dystonia . 
so here he is . 
this boy is nine years old , perfectly normal until the age six , and then he started twisting his body , first the right foot , then the left foot , then the right arm , then the left arm , then the trunk , and then by the time he arrived , within the course of one or two years of the disease onset , he could no longer walk , he could no longer stand . 
he was crippled , and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted , progressively disabled , and many of these children do not survive . 
the area of the brain for sadness is on red hot . 
so we wondered , can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat , can we turn down the activity , and what will be the consequence of that ? 
and we placed electrodes in area 25 , and in the top scan you see before the operation , area 25 , the sadness area is red hot , and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue , and then , after three months of continuous stimulation , 24 hours a day , or six months of continuous stimulation , we have a complete reversal of this . 
they shut down . they turn off . 
the lights are out in these areas of the brain . 
thank you very much . 
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies . 
so it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then . 
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table . 
so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions . 
and so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered . 
and so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where i work with people from different disciplines - - artists , technologists , scientists - - to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human - glacier relations . 
we want to see and measure storms - - brainstorms , that is . 
actually , the first time we recorded more than one neuron - - a hundred brain cells simultaneously - - we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal , this is the first image we got , the first 10 seconds of this recording . 
so we got a little snippet of a thought , and we could see it in front of us . 
we are doing a thousand now . 
everything that we ever do , everything that every human has ever done , do or will do , requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms . 
this is a brain . 
this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this - - my brain , any brain . 
and what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies , these brain symphonies , and try to extract from them the messages they carry . 
and you have a scheme here that describes how it works . 
and if we can actually provide feedback , sensory signals that go back from this robotic , mechanical , computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain , back to the brain , how the brain deals with that , of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery . 
as you can see here , she likes to use a joystick , like any one of us , any of our kids , to play this game . 
so every trajectory that you see of the cursor now , this is the exact first moment she got that . 
well , she did that because she , at that time , had acquired a new arm . 
just fast forward 10 years . 
the brain is assimilating that too , as fast as we can measure . 
so where are we taking all this ? 
well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world . 
so our idea is to create a bypass , is to use these brain - machine interfaces to read these signals , larger - scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again , bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body , a whole body called an exoskeleton , a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients . 
this same mechanism , we hope , will allow these patients , not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body , but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls . 
the napalm is burning there quite nicely . 
so this is what happens as that burn gets going . 
i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday , because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again . 
it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous . 
if it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill . 
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water . 
it spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it . 
it is green . it is a shrine to greenishness . 
and we get kind of in on our own con . 
i mean - - and this is funny , it looks funny here . 
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states . 
this is an early - on photograph - - you can see , we had these gushers . 
okay , so that guy is actually still with us . 
you have these pictures of birds . 
everything that we are really stemmed from this period . 
we were very reactive , as opposed to being proactive about what happened . 
and so what we did was , actually , we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling . 
as you can see , our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out . 
we put it in . there was a tremendous banditry problem . 
now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car . 
what are the laws ? what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ? 
one thing is - - we need to stay away from the theater . 
it comes in on the side - - the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un - useful stuff , which is called the rejected energy - - the waste , goes up to the top . 
we have policies that reward sprawl - - we have all kinds of policies . 
let me give you a little sense of how this would work . 
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there . 
so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics . 
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma . 
you just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out . 
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid . 
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience . 
there is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world , on the street , that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with , and that is that all of us want to be happy . 
now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while . 
learning patience , for instance . 
so how can we find a method that will harness this ? 
you open your ears . you open your nose . 
you open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us . 
and then we can also open our hearts , our hearts for the opportunities , for the opportunities also to help others , to make others happy , because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy . 
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony . 
your ears are always on - - you have no ear lids . 
the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters . 
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening . 
here are two of them . 
men typically listen reductively . 
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time . 
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler . 
we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this . 
and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed . 
there is a cost of compression . 
i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art . 
i do urge you to explore this . 
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions . 
and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved . 
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely . 
my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction . 
but before i do that , i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics , which require huge amounts of energy to create and , because of their disposal issues , are slowly poisoning our planet . 
this is a material you all know is styrofoam , but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff . 
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops . 
today , we use a single feedstock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you . 
we should be talking about half , a quarter , one - tenth the energy content . 
i fit into it , you fit into it , and a hundred years tops , my body can return to the earth with no preprocessing . 
yet that packaging i got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years . 
this is crazy . 
but nature provides us with a really good model here . 
and this gets us back to the mushrooms . 
and by using mycelium as a glue , you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry , and you can create materials with many different properties , materials that are insulating , fire - resistant , moisture - resistant , vapor - resistant - - materials that can absorb impacts , that can absorb acoustical impacts . 
the next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool , physically filling an enclosure , a mold , in whatever shape you want to get . 
our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production . 
we then process these husks with some basic equipment . 
so in front of your eyes , this part just self - assembled . 
they used to use a plastic packaging buffer , but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material . 
the next is self - assembly , because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process . 
and i think that can be some really good news . 
when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china , it has , you know , led to considerable angst amongst the western populations . 
interestingly , what he finds is — and by the way , the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations : how many times does a future patent reference the older patent ? — he finds something very interesting . 
the second kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies , where many companies today are contracting indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world . 
the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process innovations , because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms . 
what the global delivery model allows is , it allows you to take previously geographically core - located tasks , break them up into parts , send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists , and then specify the means for reintegrating them . 
so , if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs , at some stage , the next step of the ladder has to follow . 
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives , where these people have enough access to education and health care , so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear . 
the children were killed on the spot . 
and they were able to get tens of thousands of , primarily , women , some men , in the streets to bring about change . 
we had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process , and people came out from all over the city , including areas that were stable neighborhoods , as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy . 
and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things . 
so they , too , could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided . 
and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do . 
i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe . 
and where in the world would you find such water ? 
they work on a shoestring budget . 
the fabric alone weighs two tons . 
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub - zero temperatures . 
one is exploring the cosmos on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being . 
alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice . 
and you can imagine what that would be like , right , in your own life - - and i know this is true of some of you - - if you were drinking all day , and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life , you would have better ideas . 
it was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds , different fields of expertise , and share . 
this was their conjugal bed , in a sense - - ideas would get together there . 
and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story . 
what are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation , unusual levels of creativity ? 
they decided to tackle this really pressing problem of , you know , the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates in the developing world . 
and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries , and then it ends up being useless . 
they seem to have the expertise to keep cars working . 
and this is what they ended up coming with . 
i mean , this is one vision of it . 
this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , unpredictable collisions - - people from different backgrounds . 
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually - - when you research this field - - people are notoriously unreliable , when they actually kind of self - report on where they have their own good ideas , or their history of their best ideas . 
they happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting , when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings , oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having , the error , the noise in the signal they were discovering . 
and now , i guarantee you certainly half of this room , if not more , has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space . 
and i bet you one of you , if not more , has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last - - in the last day or last week , right ? 
and that , i think , is a great case study , a great lesson in the power , the marvelous , kind of unplanned emergent , unpredictable power of open innovative systems . 
chance favors the connected mind . 
thank you very much . 
but i would say no . 
in this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc . 
and we even have to be asked sometimes , very kindly , to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons . 
then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent . 
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean . 
well we have a whole o . r . team , general anesthesia , nurses , and another doctor across from me . 
and there is probably a better way to do this . 
we can do multiple passes through that same entry . 
no robots required . 
this was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient . 
it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live - saving bone marrow donors . 
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber - illusionist . 
texting has a 100 percent open rate . 
now the parents are really alarmed . 
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things - - charting the future essentially . 
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen . 
now in hindsight , it was actually good for some things , like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid , but at the time this was really doomsday . 
the shake developed out of , really , a single - minded pursuit of pointillism , just years of making tiny , tiny dots . 
and eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles , because of the shake . 
the same thing the next day , and then the next , quickly slipping into a creative slump . 
and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands . 
embrace the shake . 
what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation , as each time i created , the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project . 
it did not happen overnight . 
and the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging , non - verbal feedback like this . 
go ! 
it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage . 
how would that extend to advice , like , if someone is making a lifestyle choice between , say , a stressful job and a non - stressful job , does it matter which way they go ? 
every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs . 
that what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse . 
what costs us 10 pounds in a different context we may actually welcome . 
but this does not apply the other way around . 
on the other hand , change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management , so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company , it goes to charity , and the mental willingness to pay completely changes . 
if that seems like some strange , abstruse thing , in the u . k . , the post office had a 98 percent success rate at delivering first - class mail the next day . 
then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink . 
from her , i learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson - - that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls . 
in retrospect , i think she was slightly worried about my sanity . 
in our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy . 
i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there . 
everywhere i went , i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me . 
one is interested in sweeping generalizations . 
the other , in nuances . 
one draws boundaries . 
the other recognizes no frontiers . 
identity politics is made of solid bricks . 
books have saved the introverted , timid child that i was - - that i once was . 
like that , my fiction as well . 
which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable , vivid journey in translation . 
so no ego problems . 
anyway , as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was , it was that second part , being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining , where the futility of my quest really set in . 
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon - to - be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect . 
it takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world . 
his intent is to be funny . 
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight - or - fight responses , operate . 
have at it you radical bastards . the field is yours . 
economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy . 
first there were drums and then knock - knock jokes . 
how about that ? how about we create a better world for nothing ? 
that is a lot of punch for 14 words . 
boy : no , you play mom and i play dad . 
girl : women ! one word and they get upset . 
it is where a third of all the traffic is going . 
and i ended up on top . 
i ended up at this really fancy party . 
and saying whatever you like , i think , is powerful . 
doing whatever you like is now crossing a line . 
but words , saying things , you know , can be constructive ; it can be really damaging . 
99 percent of it is just , would have been , you know , bleeped out . 
okay , well . 
lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime . 
these are both real objects . 
one goes extinct for the other to survive . 
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas . 
so the gains from trade are only going to grow . 
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by . 
you find a sheep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it . 
the stone axe was made by someone for himself . 
so when did this habit start ? 
their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today . 
it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men . 
in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30 , 000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more - - but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away . 
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4 , 000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had . 
i mean this quite seriously . 
and yet despite this , hardly any of us have ever heard space . 
but like any long length of charged wire , it also inadvertently became an antenna . 
he had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them . 
but it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades . 
well , commercial hunting happened . 
these birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton , and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground , they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands . 
by the end of the century , there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers . 
it was hunted to death for its feathers . 
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen . 
it was loved . they tried to protect it . it died anyway . 
de - extinction falls in that category . 
he showed how all of this can be put together . 
so what do you do about that ? 
everybody thought is was finished . 
there were just 254 left . 
what are they concerned about ? 
so even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain , by the time the structure has been folded , its physical location is very different between individuals , even identical twins . 
there is no longer any consistency in the surface signals . 
so : one , two , three , go . 
same sort of drill . so : one , two , three , go . 
good job . good job . 
now blink right to go right . 
now blink left to turn back left . 
so it evolved . 
now there are 192 . 
but i think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions . 
40 billion of these things built . 
the most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that . 
the light bulb was a fairly simple task , from their standpoint . 
home electronics . 
by the way , i do make it look a little bit easier than it is . 
most of the time it looked like this . 
the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone . 
this is as messy as it gets . 
are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? and so forth . 
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual . 
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spatial operating environment , we call it . 
you have to be able to navigate in 3d . 
and we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest . 
so this is the inevitability about it . 
i wanted to be a biker chick . 
because they were all about being free , the wind in your hair - - just to be free . 
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun . 
i am , and have been since birth , legally blind . 
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ? 
hey . 
no limitations . 
but very quickly i recovered . it was like that . 
and you know , disabled people are hugely educated . 
and temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped . 
but all that belief had fueled me so long . 
can i tell you , airports are a disaster . 
oh , for the love of god . 
god no , it was therapy . 
hardly appropriate at this moment in time . 
and i had no idea where i was going . i had no idea . 
and there i was crying away , and smash , bash on my rock . 
six thousand people got to see because of that . 
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible . 
and stop with the labels , the limiting . 
so i imagine my life : if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal , and they found it , and , in fact , they found lots of it right here . 
and back here in the united states , we saw economic despair , deprivation . 
and just imagine what you would feel . 
somebody else has a design for it . 
when oil was at stake , somehow , suddenly , things mattered . 
they worship the christian god , they have crosses , they carry bibles . 
and their leaders , their leaders : before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country - - and you know the reason - - before they send them off , they go to a christian church , and they pray to their christian god , and they ask for protection and guidance from that god . 
and you feel something about that - - of course you do . 
you pass it around . you pass his words around . 
this is frightening . 
these christians , who are these christians ? 
these christians are nuts . 
and this is a perspective . 
now here comes the radical experiment . 
okay , try this . bring it back . 
can you feel the rage ? 
can you go there ? 
which one ? 
can you imagine saying that ? 
can you go there ? 
attend to other lives , other visions . 
even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework , for instance . 
you house is in a terrible state . 
your partner is about to return . 
even on my journey up here - - the joy that i have on my journey up here every single time . 
the 404 page is that . 
you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey . 
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator , and we had eight startups sitting around there . 
so over time , time and space have compressed because of this . 
and then , once you do that , you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way , instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in - - and oh , i have to do this , and i have to do this , and i have to do this . 
how could this have gone by like lightning ? 
as a matter of fact , this picture is supposed to be me during training . 
and i put together an expedition . 
the navigation is difficult . 
and there are all kinds of problems . 
no stone left unturned . 
and i was on fire - - excruciating , excruciating pain . 
and the next thing is paralysis . 
the box jelly again - - all across the neck , all across here . 
and i got back in . 
a lot of athletes have this , you know , sort of invincibility . 
and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50 - ft . tentacles . 
and they do this wrapping . 
and so , what after that ? 
live it large . live it large . 
and i just ate it up . 
i drew , and i drew , and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family , i could draw , do what i wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak - - i was very shy - - and i could still get approval . 
i was launched as a cartoonist . 
it takes what we know , and it twists it . 
and then also my family was in chaos , and i drew to try to bring my family together - - - - try to bring my family together with laughter . 
consequently , we have . 
we have amazing antennae . 
but i feel blessed to be able to work with them . 
and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected , that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all , and maybe engage them to make a difference . 
i then had a bit of a wake - up call when i was 14 . 
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy . 
it was also a pretty good year for this guy . 
how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas ? 
we could have been done by lunch here . 
so here i was . 
just absolutely amazing , every single dive . 
cephalopods - - head - foots . as a kid i knew them as calamari , mostly . 
tough thing to do . 
disappears right into the background . 
watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture . 
and these are made of this kind of tube - - electricity tube , we call it in holland . 
and that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way . 
can i have the feeler here ? 
it gets way better . 
before we think about where we go from here . 
so clearly , apocalyptically - minded authors have overstated the case . 
first of all , there is a suggestion of some error . 
okay . 
first of all , recognizing that the glass is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration , whereas if we thought we were already there , there would be no particular point to pushing harder . 
give it up for that . 
how about that ? 
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work - - i would hope , at least . 
you almost never hear someone say the office . 
i did these conference calls . i did all this stuff . 
at the office , most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary .

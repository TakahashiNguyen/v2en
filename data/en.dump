last friday , the australian government said the local police forces had seized several sea freight containers with some a $ 1 . 6 billion ( $ 1 . 1 billion ) worth of crystal meth , which had been concealed among marble stones . it was believed to be the biggest ever haul of the banned substance in the country . 
in the mountains of central vietnam , two huge hands lift a golden walkway high above the mountaintops . it is as if the ground below has taken a human form and grown arms . “ i feel like i ’ m walking on clouds , ” said vuong thuy linh , a visitor from hanoi . “ it ’ s so unique ” . 
the walkway sits at over 1 , 000 meters above sea level and extends over the treetops from the edge of a leafy cliff . it offers visitors a clear , unrestricted view of the beautiful countryside below . 
“ it creates a walkway in the sky , among the foggy and fairy - like lands of ba na mountain , ” he told the reuters news agency . 


it is known that the 55 - faced diamond , or carbonado , had been created by a meteorite or an asteroid that hit the earth around 2 . 6 billion years ago . 
students from kindergarten to high school levels would return to school on march 2 , while those from vocational schools would return on march 8 . university student schedules would be determined by the schools themselves , though the national steering committee for covid - 19 prevention and control recommended they reopen starting march 15 to ensure social distancing measures , the municipal people ' s committee said yesterday . 
when students are back to school , parents need to take their children ' s body temperatures at home , prepare them masks and personal items so they would not have to share them with classmates to avoid infection , city authorities said . schools are required to regularly disinfect areas , especially those being constantly touched , and vehicles used to carry students . 




her trip to the two southeast asian countries this month is to reinforce global partnerships . the us vice president will engage the leaders of both vietnam and singapore on issues of mutual interest , including regional security , the global response to the coronavirus epidemic , and climate change , harris ' communications director symone sanders said . 


but still , we look at the pieces . 
and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us . 
so you can imagine the scale of the effort . 
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
so put your arms back up and flex your bicep . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
they are neither feral nor myopically self - absorbed . 

any powerful technology is inherently dual use , and , you know , you get something like synthetic biology , nanobiotechnology , it really compels you , you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups , because they have better infrastructure , they have better facilities , and they have access to pathogens . 

now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
we started physiotherapy , we started the rehabilitation , and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot . 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
not anymore . 
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air . 
and as you can imagine , i hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity . 
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks - - all kinds of versions of pain . 
and i want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities , and i want to talk to you about cheating . 
i would pass their sheet of paper . 
turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments - - and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments - - but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all . 
no bill ever disappeared . 
when the actor who was getting up was a carnegie mellon student - - he was actually a carnegie mellon student - - but he was a part of their group , cheating went up . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
the clientele behavior was very much the same too . 
this is a little bit later . 
and well , that was an opera experience . 
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music . 
and this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone . 
the tempos are medium . it sounds big . 
and does it happen anywhere else ? 
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ? 
i came this close to doing it . 
and it became really big at some point . 
and that was the end of it . 
thank you guys . 
a teacher told me how to express the under - five - percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream . 
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l . a . airport . 
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one - third of a millimeter . 
straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process . 
and as you can see from these maps of london , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people . 
a plastic laminate company , which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world - - they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york , in 2000 . 

what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
this trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system . 
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream . 
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom - modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease - modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind - up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain . 
this is a polio vaccine . 
and not only that , but when they came into these countries , then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia , where , for the first time in over a decade last year , children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years . 
but the third challenge we have - - and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge - - is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy - - every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash . 
and these heroes , they come from every walk of life , all sorts of backgrounds . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances . 
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this . 
we have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics . 
where would you say we need to be the smartest ? 
give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year . 
it sounds like a lot of money ; it is a lot of money . 
this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side . 
sometimes i share that information , yeah . 
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys . 
we all looked up to him . 
it was way more important to me , about me and my man box card than about sheila and what was happening to her . 
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door . 
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 

and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be . 
and yet , he did not die . 
so what do we make of all of this ? 
well , one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to what i did at the end was a piece of paper , the advance directive , to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
on the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom . 
shawn achor : the happy secret to better work 
so we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
and you could see how my poor , manipulated sister faced conflict , as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced , or contemplating her new - found identity as a unicorn . 
what we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven - - we had no idea at the time - - was something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain . 
this graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning . 
which , even at yale , is extraordinarily rare . 
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior . 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of . 
in just a two - minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully . 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters . 

and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier . 
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa , from australia to oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 , and again in russia in 2010 . 
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta . 
beyond these technical solutions , our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change . 
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities .

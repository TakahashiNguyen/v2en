and this is the tower from below . 
well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
so he got the right weight at birth . 
and what went wrong ? 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
any science geeks , you get that one . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
it actually improves it . 
thank you very much . 
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . 
and that was the end of it . 
now , melting point has a lot to do with this . 
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge . 
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
the ordering principle of his vision . 
cows with a view . 
so that became a challenge . 
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want . 
and in each of those , it was only part of the country . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
and yet , the impossible is happening . 
and that great buy costs us a little bit more . 
hold your head up . look at me . 
he was cool . he was fine . 
we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn . . . 
and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints . 
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat . 
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise . 
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed . 
and at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first . 
and finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness .

we all looked up to him . 
now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy . 
you do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you . 
and we did an operation , and my company did a dawn attack - - you know , the classic dawn attack : you prepare all night , move to the line of departure . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
we move forward , and we get wiped out - - i mean , wiped out immediately . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
and yet , we need to have that shared sense . 
think about knowing that over time . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing . 
that was my journey . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
you need first funds . 
this removes the distinction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state .

if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet . 
this brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race . 
it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million . 
but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years , our future is in space . 
that is why i am in favor of manned - - or should i say , personed - - space flight . 
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then . 
it makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on . 
so he enters a clinical trial , and it works . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .

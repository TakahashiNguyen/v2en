last friday , the australian government said the local police forces had seized several sea freight containers with some a $ 1 . 6 billion ( $ 1 . 1 billion ) worth of crystal meth , which had been concealed among marble stones . it was believed to be the biggest ever haul of the banned substance in the country . 
in the mountains of central vietnam , two huge hands lift a golden walkway high above the mountaintops . it is as if the ground below has taken a human form and grown arms . “ i feel like i ’ m walking on clouds , ” said vuong thuy linh , a visitor from hanoi . “ it ’ s so unique ” . 
the walkway sits at over 1 , 000 meters above sea level and extends over the treetops from the edge of a leafy cliff . it offers visitors a clear , unrestricted view of the beautiful countryside below . 
“ it creates a walkway in the sky , among the foggy and fairy - like lands of ba na mountain , ” he told the reuters news agency . 


it is known that the 55 - faced diamond , or carbonado , had been created by a meteorite or an asteroid that hit the earth around 2 . 6 billion years ago . 
students from kindergarten to high school levels would return to school on march 2 , while those from vocational schools would return on march 8 . university student schedules would be determined by the schools themselves , though the national steering committee for covid - 19 prevention and control recommended they reopen starting march 15 to ensure social distancing measures , the municipal people ' s committee said yesterday . 
when students are back to school , parents need to take their children ' s body temperatures at home , prepare them masks and personal items so they would not have to share them with classmates to avoid infection , city authorities said . schools are required to regularly disinfect areas , especially those being constantly touched , and vehicles used to carry students . 




her trip to the two southeast asian countries this month is to reinforce global partnerships . the us vice president will engage the leaders of both vietnam and singapore on issues of mutual interest , including regional security , the global response to the coronavirus epidemic , and climate change , harris ' communications director symone sanders said . 


but still , we look at the pieces . 
and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us . 
so you can imagine the scale of the effort . 
you had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
so put your arms back up and flex your bicep . 
the films provided communality across all manner of divide . 
they are neither feral nor myopically self - absorbed . 

any powerful technology is inherently dual use , and , you know , you get something like synthetic biology , nanobiotechnology , it really compels you , you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups , because they have better infrastructure , they have better facilities , and they have access to pathogens . 

now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
we started physiotherapy , we started the rehabilitation , and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot . 
it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation . 
not anymore . 
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air . 
and as you can imagine , i hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity . 
and i would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks - - all kinds of versions of pain . 
and i want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities , and i want to talk to you about cheating . 
i would pass their sheet of paper . 
turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments - - and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments - - but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all . 
no bill ever disappeared . 
when the actor who was getting up was a carnegie mellon student - - he was actually a carnegie mellon student - - but he was a part of their group , cheating went up . 
everybody is thrown off . you go in for the kill . 
the clientele behavior was very much the same too . 
this is a little bit later . 
and well , that was an opera experience . 
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music . 
and this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone . 
the tempos are medium . it sounds big . 
and does it happen anywhere else ? 
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ? 
i came this close to doing it . 
and it became really big at some point . 
and that was the end of it . 
thank you guys . 
a teacher told me how to express the under - five - percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream . 
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l . a . airport . 
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one - third of a millimeter . 
straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process . 
and as you can see from these maps of london , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people . 
a plastic laminate company , which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world - - they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york , in 2000 . 

what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell . 
this trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system . 
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream . 
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom - modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease - modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind - up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain . 
this is a polio vaccine . 
and not only that , but when they came into these countries , then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia , where , for the first time in over a decade last year , children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years . 
but the third challenge we have - - and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge - - is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy - - every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash . 
and these heroes , they come from every walk of life , all sorts of backgrounds . 
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict . 
umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances . 
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this . 
we have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics . 
where would you say we need to be the smartest ? 
give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year . 
it sounds like a lot of money ; it is a lot of money . 
this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side . 
sometimes i share that information , yeah . 
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys . 
we all looked up to him . 
it was way more important to me , about me and my man box card than about sheila and what was happening to her . 
you go through some additional checks , and then they open the door . 
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much . 
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger . 

and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be . 
and yet , he did not die . 
so what do we make of all of this ? 
well , one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to what i did at the end was a piece of paper , the advance directive , to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices . 
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go . 
on the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom . 
shawn achor : the happy secret to better work 
so we were up on top of our bunk beds . 
and you could see how my poor , manipulated sister faced conflict , as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced , or contemplating her new - found identity as a unicorn . 
what we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven - - we had no idea at the time - - was something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain . 
this graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning . 
which , even at yale , is extraordinarily rare . 
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior . 
what we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of . 
in just a two - minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully . 
exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters . 

and the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , i think we could get people to both be more productive and happier . 
farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa , from australia to oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in 2003 , and again in russia in 2010 . 
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta . 
beyond these technical solutions , our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change . 
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities . 






























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































we found a global atmospheric watchtower there , in the middle of the rainforest , and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower , to look for isoprene , and of course , other things while we were there . 
and this is the tower from below . 
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering . 
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king . 
and it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle . 
and though not real , eve harrington , howard beale , mildred pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human , and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england . 
so i immediately called her up , of course . 
and then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , & quot ; oh , my god . 
so i whistle the tone . 
so he got the right weight at birth . 
so we were pretty reassured by this . 
and what went wrong ? 
but we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity . 
porous , nonporous . 
and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . 
dan ariely : our buggy moral code 
do you rip it off quickly - - short duration but high intensity - - or do you take your band - aid off slowly - - you take a long time , but each second is not as painful - - which one of those is the right approach ? 
and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world . 
and when i finished hurting people a little bit , i would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ? 
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ? 
when the five minutes were over , i would say , & quot ; please shred the piece of paper . 
and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces . 
in contrast , i took a plate with six one - dollar bills , and i left those plates in the same refrigerators . 
and they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way . 
will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ? 
when we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more . 
but think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody i liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time . 
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions . 
this is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute . 
any science geeks , you get that one . 
any other thumbs ? 
so curiosity . 
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good . 
this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway . 
the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood . 
other places around the country had similar rooms . 
okay . 
around the same , according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet - - no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show . 
i grew up with a radio in a car . 
so birds do it too . 
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something . 
thank you very much . 
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . 
remember that image from the beginning ? 
and it goes the other way around . 
just read where those guys are from . 
now , melting point has a lot to do with this . 
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge . 
we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes , here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan , who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail . 
now , when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this . 
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again . 
six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 . 
none of it makes very much sense . 
fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . same thing . 
to start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place . 
all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography . 
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
we just read the back of a label on a packet . 
it even got built , but nothing to do with this vision that howard had . 
steaming piles of humus . 
so this is another one dedicated to that guy . . . 
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look . 
we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing . 
it was cadaverically cold to the touch . 
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house . 
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life . 
and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries . 
and then to make the matters even worse , the virus started to spread out of these four places , especially northern india and northern nigeria , into much of africa , asia , and even into europe , causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades . 
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters . 
and yet , the impossible is happening . 
and afghanistan , afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly . 
now what about the money ? 
and is it easy to raise that money ? 
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending . 
thank you for making your site . 
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family . 
we lived in new york city , as i said . 
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box . 
he was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old - - younger guys . 
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good . 
he was home alone a lot . 
he was cool . he was fine . 
because , while sheila never said no , she also never said yes . 
and you put on the t - 10 parachute . 
and then you put on your reserve , and then you put on your heavy rucksack . 
and i realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well . 
and i had an armored organization at that point . 
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence - - me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force - - all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder . 
that was my journey . 
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls . 
do your job simply , the girl will chase you . 
however , this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct . 
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available . 
thank you very much indeed . 
so we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty . 
and terence died six days later . 
and they were readily available . 
and on one side of the bunk bed , i had put out all of my g . i . joe soldiers and weaponry . 
now i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground . 
of course , this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past . 
and then we tailor the class right towards the average . 
their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints . 
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise . 
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed . 
doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed . 
at the top of the sheet , we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami . 
so when we think about labor , we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing , but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it - - meaning , creation , challenges , ownership , identity , pride , etc . 
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like . 
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty - six people died . nearly 300 , 000 homes were lost . 
look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events . 
after a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular taste of chicago festival into makeshift morgues , chicago became a recognized leader , tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers , outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods , planting trees , creating cool white or vegetated green roofs . 
but there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine . for example , planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated , less dense air , provides for less lift . 
hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ? 
now , i like in an audience , in britain especially , to talk about the comparison with foxhunting , which is something that was banned after a long struggle , by the government not very many months ago . 
but ultimately , the government prevailed in the end , because the majority of the british public , and certainly the majority of members of parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society . 
there are some good points to be made here , things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning so that nothing goes too - - well , so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging . 
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100 , 000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ? 
and the fundamental answer is that the pro - aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .

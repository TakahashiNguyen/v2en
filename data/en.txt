Australia seizes record amount of methamphetamine ,  worth $1 . 1 billion
Last Friday ,  the Australian government said the local police forces had seized several sea freight containers with some A$1 . 6 billion  ( $1 . 1 billion )  worth of crystal meth ,  which had been concealed among marble stones .  It was believed to be the biggest ever haul of the banned substance in the country . 
Prior to the seizing of the big amount of drug over recent weeks hidden in marble stone slabs ,  the national security forces had also confiscated about 750 kg of methylamphetamine and arrested three men a week before ,  according to New South Wales  ( NSW )  state police . 
The detection of more than 1 , 800 kg of methylamphetamine ,  in containers arriving in Sydney port ,  showed the organizational capability of the gang is enormous in terms of volume and size ,  according to NSW Detective Chief Superintendent John Watson . 
All shipments originated in the Middle East region with the consignment details were reported to be identical ,  he added . 
With white little 'crystals' and a glass-like appearance ,  the 'ice drug' is known as one of the most potent varieties of amphetamine drugs . 
In a separate incident ,  four people had been charged with shipping about A$155 million worth of crystal meth and cocaine in the headlights of a vintage Bentley car from Canada ,  NSW police said . 
Finland's PM leaked her private videos
Last Thursday ,  Finland's PM Sanna Marin spoke she was upset about her dancing videos in a private space a few weeks ago going viral on social networks while they were only shared among her friends . 
Her speech came after her two-minute video of singing and dancing with some well-known influencers and artists on social media as well as in national media a day before . 
The clips were known to have been originally uploaded to a private Instagram account .  The 36-year-old PM is the world's youngest senior leader after being elected to the chair of Finland’s PM in December 2019 .  Marin said she knew she was being filmed by that time but never thought the private videos would appear publicly . 
Meanwhile ,  there are many Finns who have voiced support for Marin for combining her private life with her own high-profile career . 
However ,  many expressed that although the young leader could have acted in good faith ,  should not be gullible ,  according to a paper . 
The video was compiled of clips from two separate parties in which people were drinking alcohol but no one took drugs ,  she said . 
The scenes are believed to have been publicly filmed about 12 months before Finland’s next general election took place .  It has been unknown who leaked the videos . 
Early this year ,  Marin told she and other senior female leaders have been also attacked with extensive hate words for their gender as well as appearance while in office . 
Walking High Above on Vietnam’s ‘Golden Bridge’
In the mountains of central Vietnam ,  two huge hands lift a golden walkway high above the mountaintops .  It is as if the ground below has taken a human form and grown arms .  “I feel like I’m walking on clouds , ” said Vuong Thuy Linh ,  a visitor from Hanoi .  “It’s so unique” . 
Many Vietnamese and foreign tourists have been to Cau Vang ,  or the “Golden Bridge” in Vietnam’s Ba Na Hills ,  since it opened in June .  Most seemed very excited to see and experience a structure known for its unusual design . 
The walkway sits at over 1 , 000 meters above sea level and extends over the treetops from the edge of a leafy cliff .  It offers visitors a clear ,  unrestricted view of the beautiful countryside below . 
The bridge was a project of TA Landscape Architecture of Ho Chi Minh City .  It was designed to create the image of the “giant hands of Gods ,  pulling a strip of gold out of the land , ” said Vu Viet Anh of TA Landscape Architecture . 
“It creates a walkway in the sky ,  among the foggy and fairy-like lands of Ba Na mountain , ” he told the Reuters news agency . 
Anh noted that he had been surprised at the level of attention the company’s design had received ,  both locally and internationally . 
Apple set to add Vietnamese to Siri

Indonesia :  A ban on cough syrup material linked to a West African country's child deaths
Last weekend ,  the Indonesian authorities launched a ban on ingredients linked to cough syrups that were believed to cause the deaths of 70 children in the West African country of Gambia .  The move came after the launch of a governmental investigation over acute kidney damage that was blamed for more than 20 children deaths in the capital Jakarta this year . 
Meanwhile ,  according to an announcement by Food and drug regulator BPOM ,  the possibility that the ingredients ,  diethylene glycol ,  and ethylene glycol have been reviewed in an investigation into how they had contaminated other materials that are used as solvents . 
Besides ,  the Gambian and Indian governments have also launched investigations over the deaths from the local cases of acute kidney injury that were said to be linked to cough syrups made by Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd ,  headquartered in New Delhi ,  India . 
In a study by The World Health Organization ,   " unacceptable "  levels of the ingredients were found in four Maiden products which can be toxic . 
To protect the health ,  at the time of registration ,  BPOM required that diethylene glycol  ( DEG )  and ethylene glycol  ( EG )  are not allowed to be present in all medicinal syrup products for children and adults ,  in a statement by the regulator . 
Accordingly ,  the four products linked to the mentioned deaths are not registered in Indonesia ,  the regulator reiterated ,  nor are any other Maiden products . 
Black diamond ,  the largest ever cut ,  sells for £3 . 2 million
Yesterday ,  a rare black diamond at 555 carats named “The Enigma "  went under the hammer in Britain’s London for £3 . 16 million  ( $4 . 3 million ,  3 . 8 million euros )  .  The world's largest known cut diamond has recently gone on display for the first time . 
It is known that the 55-faced diamond ,  or carbonado ,  had been created by a meteorite or an asteroid that hit the Earth around 2 . 6 billion years ago . 
The 555 . 55-carat diamond worth £3 . 16 million excluded the buyer's premium at an online auction of London's renowned Sotheby's auction house that also accepted crypto-currency bids . 
Carbonados are said to have extraterrestrial origins because they are usually found close to the surface of the Earth . 
The specific type of black diamond was formed from meteoric impacts that produce natural chemical vapor deposition .  Carbonado ,  one of the most difficult substances to cut ,  is also thought to be created from supernovae explosions ,  the root of diamond-bearing asteroids which collided with the Earth ultimately ,  according to the auction house . 
Previously ,  the 55-faced diamond had never been displayed by its unnamed owner over the past 20 years . 
It took three years to turn the Carbonado into a 55-face jewel which recently went on show in some venues ,  including Dubai ,  Los Angeles ,  and London ,  said experts . 
The shape of “The Enigma "  was inspired by the Hamsa ,  the Middle East palm-shaped symbol of power and protection while its faces are also related to the number five . 
It is the size ,  shape ,  and source of the black diamond that makes it groundbreaking and amazing ,  according to Tobias Kormind ,  managing director of Europe's largest online jeweler ,  Mayfair . 
He also added that diamonds are commonly cut into one of 10 popular shapes but the Carbonado's form resembles a hand . 
Despite not being a gem-quality diamond or not being normally used in jewelry or sold at auction ,  “The Enigma” ,  which Sotheby's called a  " cosmic wonder "  ,   has recently grown in popularity . 
Carbonados are commonly used in industrial drilling because of their extraordinary hardness . 
In 2021 ,  the Key 10138 diamond of Hong Kong worth 12 . 3 million dollars was also paid in crypto-currency . 
Hanoi students back to school next Tuesday
Over two million students in Hanoi would return to school on March 2 ,  about an extended one-month Tet break ,  and taking part in online classes due to Covid-19 . 
Students from kindergarten to high school levels would return to school on March 2 ,  while those from vocational schools would return on March 8 .  University student schedules would be determined by the schools themselves ,  though the National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control recommended they reopen starting March 15 to ensure social distancing measures ,  the municipal People's Committee said yesterday . 
Previously ,  Hanoi students started staying home on Feb .  1 ,  about a week earlier than the expected beginning of the Tet break due to new latest outbreak .  After the one-week holiday ,  they continued to study online . 
When students are back to school ,  parents need to take their children's body temperatures at home ,  prepare them masks and personal items so they would not have to share them with classmates to avoid infection ,  city authorities said .  Schools are required to regularly disinfect areas ,  especially those being constantly touched ,  and vehicles used to carry students . 
The capital has not recorded any community transmission for nearly two weeks .  Hanoi still has two locations under lockdown :  the Somerset hotel in Tay Ho District and a neighborhood with five families in Me Linh District .  Their lockdown would be lifted today . 
Vietnam has confirmed 2 , 426 Covid-19 infections so far ,  548 still active . 
Vietnam ranks 105th in economic freedom index
Vietnam’s economic freedom score is 58 . 8 ,  making its economy the 105th freest among 180 countries and territories in the 2020 Index of Economic Freedom by the U . S . -based Heritage Foundation . 
The research and educational institution said in the report that Vietnam’s overall score has increased by 3 . 5 points due to a dramatic gain in fiscal health . 
The Southeast Asian nation is ranked 21st among 42 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ,  and its overall score is slightly below the regional and world averages . 
The Vietnamese economy has gradually been climbing the ranks of the mostly unfree since 2011 .  Strong gross domestic product  ( GDP )  growth over the past five years has mirrored this improvement ,  driven by export-focused manufacturing and processing sectors . 
Economic freedom will be enhanced in Vietnam if the Government can successfully expand economic liberalization by promoting international trade and restructuring State-owned enterprises . 
Microsoft investigated Bill Gates' affair before he quit
Microsoft was investigating its co-founder Bill Gates over a 20-year-old affair shortly before he stepped down from the company's board last year . 
The tech giant confirmed that it had launched a probe after concerns were reported about his behavior . 
The firm said it held an investigation with a law firm and provided support to the employee who made the complaint . 
A spokesperson for Mr .  Gates denied that his decision to step back had anything to do with the investigation . 
News of the investigation emerged after Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce after 27 years of marriage . 
On Monday ,  a spokesman for Microsoft said the software company had received a complaint in late 2019 that Mr .  Gates had  " initiate an intimate relationship "  with a female employee in 2000 . 
The investigation did not reach a conclusion ,  as Mr .  Gates stepped down from the board before it was completed . 
Bill and Melinda Gates agreed 'separation contract' before announcing divorce . 
In a LinkedIn post in March of last year ,  Mr .  Gates said that he took the decision so he could spend more time on his charity work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . 
At the time ,  he wrote :   " With respect to Microsoft ,  stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company .  Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work .  .  .  I feel more optimistic than ever about the progress the company is making and how it can continue to benefit the world .  " 
However ,  the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Microsoft's board had decided that Mr .  Gates's involvement with a female employee was inappropriate and he needed to step down . 
However ,  Gates’ spokeswoman  " Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter .  In fact ,  he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier .  " 
Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce earlier this month .  The couple have spent billions on charitable causes around the world and have pledged to continue to work together at the foundation once their divorce is finalized . 
US media reported that the two had agreed on how to divide their property and assets before announcing their separation . 
Mr .  Gates ,  65 ,  is the fourth wealthiest person in the world ,  according to Forbes ,  and is worth $124bn  ( £89bn )  . 
He co-founded Microsoft - now the world's biggest software company - in the 1970s and remained full-time at the firm until 2008 . 
The couple's estate is believed to include multi-million dollar properties in the states of Washington ,  Florida ,  and Wyoming .  Their main residence is a lakeside mansion in Medina ,  Washington that is reported to be worth at least $127m . 
Samsung to shift major portion of monitor production from China to HCMC
Samsung Vina Electronics announced on June 19 that a major portion of Samsung’s monitor production would be shifted from China to the Samsung HCMC CE Complex at the Saigon Hi-tech Park in District 9 ,  HCMC ,  this year . 
The South Korean tech giant is developing a production chain for over 40 monitor models at its factory in HCMC .  Once the shift is complete ,  Vietnam will become one of the largest suppliers of Samsung monitors in the world ,  according to Tuoi Tre newspaper . 
A Samsung representative said the shift will help Vietnamese consumers become the first to use the company’s latest monitors ,  while the country will also help Samsung monitors increase their market presence in Southeast Asia . 
Data from global market intelligence firm IDC indicated that Samsung is the leading producer of monitors in Vietnam ,  with Samsung monitors of 24 inches or larger accounting for 34% of the Vietnamese market in the first quarter of 2020 . 
US Vice President is set to visit Vietnam and Singapore this month
Kamala Harris will become the first US vice president to visit Vietnam in August during her trip that will also include Singapore . 
Her trip to the two Southeast Asian countries this month is to reinforce global partnerships .  The US vice president will engage the leaders of both Vietnam and Singapore on issues of mutual interest ,  including regional security ,  the global response to the coronavirus epidemic ,  and climate change ,  Harris' communications director Symone Sanders said . 
Vietnam has received five million COVID-19 vaccine doses from the United States in a bid to fighting the global pandemic while 75 % of Singapore's population has been inoculated at least one dose . 
A good portion of Harris’ trip will likely concentrate on the importance of US partnerships in the region as the Biden administration’s focus on its ties in Asia . 
President Biden has repeatedly spoken about the need to counter China's expanding influence in the Asia-Pacific region and boost democracy in the Indo-Pacific region .  This week ,  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is on an Asia swing of his own ,  newswire The Hill reported ,  meeting with leaders in Vietnam and the Philippines . 
Harvest season of Vanh Khuyen persimmons in northern highlands
The Vanh Khuyen persimmons are native to the district bordering China .  Cultivated on steep hills and mountains in Vietnam’s northern highlands ,  the persimmon trees need careful in combination with regular weeding . 
Local farmers usually use a long bamboo stick with a cloth bag at one end to harvest the persimmons . 
The persimmons are harvested at 5 a . m .  in order to keep the overnight freshness of the fruits .    Most of these persmisson trees are grown from root-cuttings ,  not from seeds or branches .  Strong trees’ fruits can be harvested after three years ,  with output reaching their maximum in the fifth year . 
According to local farmers ,  the distinguishing feature of Vanh Khuyen persimmons is a full blossom-like sepal with round fruits ,  no seeds ,  and a crunchy ,  sweet taste .  As the fruits are ripe ,  the sepal would appear more defined . 
Harvesting takes a lot of time ,  so usually gather the fruits by some tree stumps to take a break before taking them down to sell . 
Good persimmons have gleaming skins with a chartreuse shade ,  a crispy texture ,  and a gentle sweet taste ,  a farmer said
I love you
The science behind a climate headline
In 4 minutes  ,  atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change  ,  with her team -- one of thousands who contributed -- taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule  . 
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change  ,  and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog  . 
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science  . 
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  ,  or IPCC  ,  put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system  . 
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic  . 
And every one of those scientists is in a research group  ,  and every research group studies a wide variety of topics  . 
And in each one of these research areas  ,  of which there are even more  ,  there are PhD students  ,  like me  ,  and we study incredibly narrow topics  ,  things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules  . 
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene  . 
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain  . 
But still  ,  we look at the pieces  . 
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each  ,  on minute timescales  . 
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia  .  There are others  . 
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest  ,  from above  . 
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us  . 
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today  . 
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements  . 
We have to get special flight clearance  . 
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule  ,  they write one scientific paper on the subject  . 
And as a body of knowledge builds up  ,  it will form one subsection  ,  or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC  ,  although we have others  . 
So you can imagine the scale of the effort  . 
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers  ,  in order to make headlines like these  . 
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm  . 
Well  ,  coming out of the research labs just now  ,  for our generation  ,  is the possibility to do that  . 
You had to take a spaceship  ,  shrink it down  ,  inject it into the bloodstream  . 
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries  . 
He can look at these 65 , 000 points of activation per second  . 
We all know that as we form thoughts  ,  they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains  . 
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep  . 
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself  ,  all your experiences  . 
But I want to leave with you the big question  . 
Where will we take it ?
From mother to daughter  ,  preacher to congregant  ,  teacher to pupil  ,  storyteller to audience  . 
We are inveterate storytellers  . 
And what narrative  ,  what history  ,  what identity  ,  what moral code are we imparting to our young ?
Its artists told stories across national boundaries  ,  in as many languages  ,  genres and philosophies as one can imagine  . 
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified  . 
As a human being  ,  it puts the fear of God in me  . 
The irony is palpable ; technical access has never been greater  ,  cultural access never weaker  . 
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film  ,  maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young  . 
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U . K .   ,  with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes  . 
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind  . 
By the time the pilot had finished  ,  we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join  . 
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema  ,  find and pay for the print and the projectionist  . 
It shows how to do right  ,  how to be heroically awkward  . 
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind  . 
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer  . 
By now  ,  these thoughtful  ,  opinionated  ,  curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white  ,  subtitled  ,  documentary  ,  non-narrative  ,  fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose  . 
From 25 clubs  ,  we became hundreds  ,  then thousands  ,  until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7 , 000 clubs right across the country  . 
Some of our kids started talking with their parents  ,  others with their teachers  ,  or with their friends  . 
The films provided communality across all manner of divide  . 
What would they do under the same conditions ?
Was there a hidden message ?
And as they wrote and debated  ,  rather than seeing the films as artifacts  ,  they began to see themselves  . 
In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers  . 
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions  ,  it was these teenagers that fed the crew  . 
He never mentioned that journey  . 
After two years in hiding  ,  my grandfather appeared in London  . 
And his story was hushed as he assimilated  . 
We honor reading  ,  why not honor watching with the same passion ?
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed  . 
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes  ,  yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered  . 
Ellen Jorgensen  :  Biohacking -- you can do it  ,  too
It has the power  ,  potentially  ,  to replace our fossil fuels  ,  to revolutionize medicine  ,  and to touch every aspect of our daily lives  . 
In 2009  ,  I first heard about DIYbio  . 
The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate  ,  it could really stimulate innovation  . 
I thought so  . 
The press started calling us  . 
They were opening biohacker spaces  ,  and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did  ,  more regulations  ,  less resources  . 
Biohackers work alone  . 
We reverse engineer lab equipment  . 
We hack hardware  ,  software  ,  wetware  ,  and  ,  of course  ,  the code of life  . 
Then we like to take things apart  . 
We make things glow  . 
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use  ,  and  ,  you know  ,  you get something like synthetic biology  ,  nanobiotechnology  ,  it really compels you  ,  you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups  ,  because they have better infrastructure  ,  they have better facilities  ,  and they have access to pathogens  . 
As a matter of fact  ,  DIY people from all over the world  ,  America  ,  Europe  ,  got together last year  ,  and we hammered out a common code of ethics  . 
Now  ,  we follow state and local regulations  . 
The one I liked the best is  ,  someone could download my sequence  ,  go back to the lab  ,  synthesize some fake Ellen DNA  ,  and plant it at a crime scene  . 
So this stuff is just beginning  . 
Let me show you what you could do right now  . 
Yep  ,  you guessed it  .  He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs  ,  analyzed the saliva  ,  identified the dog  ,  and confronted the dog owner  . 
Looked like a ladybug  ,  right ?
You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water  . 
You can do a lot of things  . 
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science  . 
Why not personal biotech ?
That was whistling  . 
What is a chubby  ,  curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling ?
And actually  ,  till I was 34  ,  I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  ,  because  ,  to be honest  ,  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior  . 
And they had some  ,  in my opinion  ,  terrible Christmas music  . 
I would love to  ,  but why ?
She Googled  ,  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  ,  of course  . 
And I would have lost my face  . 
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean  . 
So I went to Louisburg  ,  North Carolina  ,  southeast United States  ,  and I entered the world of whistling  . 
So I quit my day job as a nurse  . 
Well actually  ,  you are going to whistle along  . 
Sorry  .  I forgot one thing  . 
I heard a wide variety of tones  . 
This is very promising  . 
I start it myself  . 
Okay  . 
Now comes the solo  .  I propose I do that myself  . 
Geert Chatrou  :  Thank you  .  Thank you  . 
But in the end everything seemed to be under control  . 
He got the right Apgar index  . 
But at the end  ,  10 days later after he was born  ,  we discovered that he had a stroke  . 
A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth  ,  and in his case  ,  as you can see  ,  the right part of his brain has gone  . 
So life had to change  . 
We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life  . 
Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities  ,  and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds  . 
Questions  ,  some basics  ,  like  ,  you know  ,  why did this happen to us ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
And this  ,  indeed  ,  really is tough to say  ,  but a few months later  ,  we realized that we were really feeling like a failure  . 
And you know  ,  it was not a failure for ourselves in itself  ,  but it was a failure that will impact his full life  . 
I mean we went really down  ,  but at the end  ,  we started to look at him  ,  and we said  ,  we have to react  . 
We started physiotherapy  ,  we started the rehabilitation  ,  and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot  . 
You have an object  ,  and we showed him how to grab the object  . 
It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation  . 
He was looking at us  . 
And the problem  ,  as you might feel  ,  is that we were down  ,  we were depressed  ,  we were looking at him as a problem  ,  not as a son  ,  not from a positive perspective  . 
We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario  . 
We stopped looking at him as a problem  ,  and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve  . 
And we started from our passions  . 
We love to travel  ,  we love music  ,  we love to be in places like this  ,  and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him  . 
And this is the message that we want to share with you  . 
Mario !
And we thank you so much  ,  all of you  . 
Thank you  . 
Mark Shaw demos Ultra-Ever Dry  ,  a liquid-repellent coating that acts as an astonishingly powerful shield against water and water-based materials  .  At the nano level  ,  the spray covers a surface with an umbrella of air so that water bounces right off  .  Watch for an exciting two-minute kicker  . 
Not anymore  . 
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees  . 
You can see the difference  . 
Well  ,  the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface  . 
And it has billions of interstitial spaces  ,  and those spaces  ,  along with the nanoparticles  ,  reach up and grab the air molecules  ,  and cover the surface with air  . 
I mean  ,  many of you right now are probably going through your head  . 
No water  ,  no corrosion  . 
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work  . 
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital  . 
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one  ,  so they would grab hold and they would rip  ,  and they would grab hold and they would rip  . 
And as you can imagine  ,  I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity  . 
And about three years later  ,  when I left the hospital  ,  I started studying at the university  . 
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods  ,  and pain that went up and pain that went down  ,  and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain  . 
Or  ,  if you had to choose between the last two  ,  which one would you choose ?
And then  ,  like all good academic projects  ,  I got more funding  . 
But at the end of this process  ,  what I learned was that the nurses were wrong  . 
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain  . 
And from that point on I started thinking  ,  are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision  ,  or is it a more general case ?
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities  ,  and I want to talk to you about cheating  . 
So  ,  my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene  ,  exploded all of a sudden  ,  and I started thinking about what is happening here  . 
So  ,  like we usually do  ,  I decided to do a simple experiment  . 
People did this  .  I would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems  . 
I would pass their sheet of paper  . 
Now  ,  in economic theory  ,  cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis  . 
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
For some people  ,  we varied how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could steal  . 
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper  . 
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down  ,  people would cheat more  ,  but again  ,  this was not the case  . 
Now  ,  how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments  ,  given the opportunity to cheat  ,  did not cheat at all  . 
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments  ,  they stopped cheating  . 
Then they shredded it  .  No cheating whatsoever  . 
So  ,  all this was about decreasing the fudge factor  . 
No bill ever disappeared  . 
A third of the people we passed the sheet  ,  they gave it back to us  . 
And then they took the something else  ,  they walked 12 feet to the side  ,  and exchanged it for dollars  . 
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home  ,  compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
People see each other behaving  . 
What does this cause us ?
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment  ,  and we prepaid them  . 
The same thing happens  . 
Nobody knew it was an actor  . 
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Here is what happens  . 
Here is the thing  . 
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group  ,  cheating went up  . 
It was about the norms for cheating  . 
When we remind people about their morality  ,  they cheat less  . 
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
Of course they would  . 
You call them stock  ,  or stock options  ,  derivatives  ,  mortgage-backed securities  . 
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them ?
More generally  ,  I want to tell you something about behavioral economics  . 
The question is  ,  are we going to test those intuitions ?
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them  . 
And I learned two interesting things  . 
Thank you very much  . 
Okay  ,  so most people are familiar with traditional  ,  two-person thumb-wrestling  . 
There are a billion gamers on the planet now  ,  so we need more of a challenge  . 
So Eric  ,  come on over  . 
So Eric would have won  .  He was the first person to pin my thumb  . 
We can really go for it  . 
Now the only other rule you need to remember is  ,  gamer generation  ,  we like a challenge  . 
So I think we should kind of get some more involved  . 
Perfect  . 
So this is the kind of simple level  ,  right ?
This is called the Death Star Configuration  . 
This is the hardest level  .  This is the extreme  . 
Thirty seconds  .  Into the network  .  Make the node  . 
Everybody  ,  up up up up up !
All right  . 
If you have a free thumb  ,  wave it around  ,  make sure it gets connected  . 
Reach behind you  .  There you go  . 
Okay ? One  ,  two  ,  three  ,  go !
Well done  .  Thank you  .  Thank you very much  . 
So I provoked a little curiosity  . 
How about surprise ? The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising  . 
We had some contentment  . 
The most important three emotions  ,  awe and wonder  ,  we had everybody connected physically for a minute  . 
And the last emotion of pride  . 
You lost both your thumbs  . 
Now you know how to play it  .  You can teach other people  . 
According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling  ,  this makes you a grandmaster of the game  . 
So congratulations  ,  grandmasters  . 
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status  . 
I will just leave you with this tip  ,  if you want to play again  . 
Pick off the one that looks easiest  . 
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm  . 
Everybody is thrown off  .  You go in for the kill  . 
As his career grew  ,  David Byrne went from playing CBGB to Carnegie Hall  .  He asks  :  Does the venue make the music ? From outdoor drumming to Wagnerian operas to arena rock  ,  he explores how context has pushed musical innovation  . 
It was  ,  remarkably  ,  a pretty good sounding room  . 
This is a song that was recorded there  . 
The sound system was kind of decent  . 
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too  ,  pretty concise  . 
The clientele behavior was very much the same too  . 
Do I have a place  ,  a venue  ,  in mind when I write ?
Do we all make things with a venue  ,  a context  ,  in mind ?
Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa  . 
The music works perfectly in that setting  . 
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification  ,  etc  .   ,  etc  . 
In a gothic cathedral  ,  this kind of music is perfect  . 
It actually improves it  . 
This is a little bit later  . 
It fits the room perfectly  . 
And well  ,  that was an opera experience  . 
And the size of the room is not that big  . 
But Wagner made an innovation  . 
He wanted a little more bombast  ,  so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there  . 
This is Carnegie Hall  . 
They had to be very quiet  . 
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall  ,  the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural  . 
According to Scott Joplin  ,  the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs  . 
And a new form of music was born  . 
People are dancing  ,  shouting and drinking  . 
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century  ,  when this became one of the primary venues for music  . 
Microphones enabled singers  ,  in particular  ,  and musicians and composers  ,  to completely change the kind of music that they were writing  . 
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone  . 
So at this point  ,  music diverged  . 
And  ,  as with jazz  ,  the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others  . 
The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies  . 
Live performance  ,  when it was incredibly successful  ,  ended up in what is probably  ,  acoustically  ,  the worst sounding venues on the planet  :  sports stadiums  ,  basketball arenas and hockey arenas  . 
They wrote what is now called arena rock  ,  which is medium-speed ballads  . 
The tempos are medium  .  It sounds big  . 
The music that  ,  I would say  ,  is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it  . 
Automobile music  ,  you can share with your friends  . 
Presumably  ,  this is just for Christian music  . 
And does it happen anywhere else ?
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States  ,  where the forests are a little denser  ,  has one kind of call  ,  and the tananger on the other side  ,  on the west has a different kind of call  . 
And I thought  :  Well  ,  if this is a model for creation  ,  if we make music  ,  primarily the form at least  ,  to fit these contexts  ,  and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls  ,  and if we write software to fit existing operating systems  ,  is that how it works ?
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view  . 
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting  . 
We adapt  . 
And like the birds  ,  the joy is still there  ,  even though we have changed what we do to fit the context  . 
Kevin Breel  :  Confessions of a depressed comic
And in the life that everyone sees  ,  who I am is a friend  ,  a son  ,  a brother  ,  a stand-up comedian and a teenager  . 
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right  . 
I came this close to doing it  . 
Well  ,  I survived  ,  and that just leaves me with my story  ,  and my story is this  :  In four simple words  ,  I suffer from depression  . 
Some people might fear sharks  .  Some people might fear death  . 
I feared my truth  ,  I feared my honesty  ,  I feared my vulnerability  ,  and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner  ,  like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out  ,  and so I thought about that way every single day  . 
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one  . 
It has to start with me  ,  it has to start with you  ,  it has to start with the people who are suffering  ,  the ones who are hidden in the shadows  . 
And I believe that we can  . 
This is a dream come true  .  Thank you  . 
On March 14  ,  this year  ,  I posted this poster on Facebook  . 
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted  . 
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now  ,  and we have people  ,  you know  ,  afraid  . 
And now people from Iran are talking to me  . 
People are crying  ,  and she came  ,  she read the text  ,  and she started to cry  . 
So I &apos;m going to shoot all the people I know  ,  if they want  ,  and I &apos;m going to put them in a poster and I &apos;m going to share them  . 
So here are a few of them  . 
The day after  ,  Iranians started to respond with their own posters  . 
Crazy  ,  crazy  . 
They want to respond  .  They want to say the same thing  .

Australia seizes record amount of methamphetamine ,  worth $1 . 1 billion
Last Friday ,  the Australian government said the local police forces had seized several sea freight containers with some A$1 . 6 billion  ( $1 . 1 billion )  worth of crystal meth ,  which had been concealed among marble stones .  It was believed to be the biggest ever haul of the banned substance in the country . 
Prior to the seizing of the big amount of drug over recent weeks hidden in marble stone slabs ,  the national security forces had also confiscated about 750 kg of methylamphetamine and arrested three men a week before ,  according to New South Wales  ( NSW )  state police . 
The detection of more than 1 , 800 kg of methylamphetamine ,  in containers arriving in Sydney port ,  showed the organizational capability of the gang is enormous in terms of volume and size ,  according to NSW Detective Chief Superintendent John Watson . 
All shipments originated in the Middle East region with the consignment details were reported to be identical ,  he added . 
With white little 'crystals' and a glass-like appearance ,  the 'ice drug' is known as one of the most potent varieties of amphetamine drugs . 
In a separate incident ,  four people had been charged with shipping about A$155 million worth of crystal meth and cocaine in the headlights of a vintage Bentley car from Canada ,  NSW police said . 
Finland's PM leaked her private videos
Last Thursday ,  Finland's PM Sanna Marin spoke she was upset about her dancing videos in a private space a few weeks ago going viral on social networks while they were only shared among her friends . 
Her speech came after her two-minute video of singing and dancing with some well-known influencers and artists on social media as well as in national media a day before . 
The clips were known to have been originally uploaded to a private Instagram account .  The 36-year-old PM is the world's youngest senior leader after being elected to the chair of Finland’s PM in December 2019 .  Marin said she knew she was being filmed by that time but never thought the private videos would appear publicly . 
Meanwhile ,  there are many Finns who have voiced support for Marin for combining her private life with her own high-profile career . 
However ,  many expressed that although the young leader could have acted in good faith ,  should not be gullible ,  according to a paper . 
The video was compiled of clips from two separate parties in which people were drinking alcohol but no one took drugs ,  she said . 
The scenes are believed to have been publicly filmed about 12 months before Finland’s next general election took place .  It has been unknown who leaked the videos . 
Early this year ,  Marin told she and other senior female leaders have been also attacked with extensive hate words for their gender as well as appearance while in office . 
Walking High Above on Vietnam’s ‘Golden Bridge’
In the mountains of central Vietnam ,  two huge hands lift a golden walkway high above the mountaintops .  It is as if the ground below has taken a human form and grown arms .  “I feel like I’m walking on clouds , ” said Vuong Thuy Linh ,  a visitor from Hanoi .  “It’s so unique” . 
Many Vietnamese and foreign tourists have been to Cau Vang ,  or the “Golden Bridge” in Vietnam’s Ba Na Hills ,  since it opened in June .  Most seemed very excited to see and experience a structure known for its unusual design . 
The walkway sits at over 1 , 000 meters above sea level and extends over the treetops from the edge of a leafy cliff .  It offers visitors a clear ,  unrestricted view of the beautiful countryside below .

Indonesia :  A ban on cough syrup material linked to a West African country's child deaths
Last weekend ,  the Indonesian authorities launched a ban on ingredients linked to cough syrups that were believed to cause the deaths of 70 children in the West African country of Gambia .  The move came after the launch of a governmental investigation over acute kidney damage that was blamed for more than 20 children deaths in the capital Jakarta this year . 
Meanwhile ,  according to an announcement by Food and drug regulator BPOM ,  the possibility that the ingredients ,  diethylene glycol ,  and ethylene glycol have been reviewed in an investigation into how they had contaminated other materials that are used as solvents . 
Besides ,  the Gambian and Indian governments have also launched investigations over the deaths from the local cases of acute kidney injury that were said to be linked to cough syrups made by Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd ,  headquartered in New Delhi ,  India . 
In a study by The World Health Organization ,   " unacceptable "  levels of the ingredients were found in four Maiden products which can be toxic . 
To protect the health ,  at the time of registration ,  BPOM required that diethylene glycol  ( DEG )  and ethylene glycol  ( EG )  are not allowed to be present in all medicinal syrup products for children and adults ,  in a statement by the regulator . 
Accordingly ,  the four products linked to the mentioned deaths are not registered in Indonesia ,  the regulator reiterated ,  nor are any other Maiden products . 
Black diamond ,  the largest ever cut ,  sells for £3 . 2 million
Yesterday ,  a rare black diamond at 555 carats named “The Enigma "  went under the hammer in Britain’s London for £3 . 16 million  ( $4 . 3 million ,  3 . 8 million euros )  .  The world's largest known cut diamond has recently gone on display for the first time . 
It is known that the 55-faced diamond ,  or carbonado ,  had been created by a meteorite or an asteroid that hit the Earth around 2 . 6 billion years ago . 
The 555 . 55-carat diamond worth £3 . 16 million excluded the buyer's premium at an online auction of London's renowned Sotheby's auction house that also accepted crypto-currency bids . 
Carbonados are said to have extraterrestrial origins because they are usually found close to the surface of the Earth . 
The specific type of black diamond was formed from meteoric impacts that produce natural chemical vapor deposition .  Carbonado ,  one of the most difficult substances to cut ,  is also thought to be created from supernovae explosions ,  the root of diamond-bearing asteroids which collided with the Earth ultimately ,  according to the auction house . 
Previously ,  the 55-faced diamond had never been displayed by its unnamed owner over the past 20 years . 
It took three years to turn the Carbonado into a 55-face jewel which recently went on show in some venues ,  including Dubai ,  Los Angeles ,  and London ,  said experts . 
The shape of “The Enigma "  was inspired by the Hamsa ,  the Middle East palm-shaped symbol of power and protection while its faces are also related to the number five . 
It is the size ,  shape ,  and source of the black diamond that makes it groundbreaking and amazing ,  according to Tobias Kormind ,  managing director of Europe's largest online jeweler ,  Mayfair . 
He also added that diamonds are commonly cut into one of 10 popular shapes but the Carbonado's form resembles a hand . 
Despite not being a gem-quality diamond or not being normally used in jewelry or sold at auction ,  “The Enigma” ,  which Sotheby's called a  " cosmic wonder "  ,   has recently grown in popularity . 
Carbonados are commonly used in industrial drilling because of their extraordinary hardness . 
In 2021 ,  the Key 10138 diamond of Hong Kong worth 12 . 3 million dollars was also paid in crypto-currency . 
Hanoi students back to school next Tuesday
Over two million students in Hanoi would return to school on March 2 ,  about an extended one-month Tet break ,  and taking part in online classes due to Covid-19 . 
Students from kindergarten to high school levels would return to school on March 2 ,  while those from vocational schools would return on March 8 .  University student schedules would be determined by the schools themselves ,  though the National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control recommended they reopen starting March 15 to ensure social distancing measures ,  the municipal People's Committee said yesterday . 
Previously ,  Hanoi students started staying home on Feb .  1 ,  about a week earlier than the expected beginning of the Tet break due to new latest outbreak .  After the one-week holiday ,  they continued to study online . 
When students are back to school ,  parents need to take their children's body temperatures at home ,  prepare them masks and personal items so they would not have to share them with classmates to avoid infection ,  city authorities said .  Schools are required to regularly disinfect areas ,  especially those being constantly touched ,  and vehicles used to carry students . 
The capital has not recorded any community transmission for nearly two weeks .  Hanoi still has two locations under lockdown :  the Somerset hotel in Tay Ho District and a neighborhood with five families in Me Linh District .  Their lockdown would be lifted today . 
Vietnam has confirmed 2 , 426 Covid-19 infections so far ,  548 still active . 
Vietnam ranks 105th in economic freedom index
Vietnam’s economic freedom score is 58 . 8 ,  making its economy the 105th freest among 180 countries and territories in the 2020 Index of Economic Freedom by the U . S . -based Heritage Foundation . 
The research and educational institution said in the report that Vietnam’s overall score has increased by 3 . 5 points due to a dramatic gain in fiscal health . 
The Southeast Asian nation is ranked 21st among 42 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ,  and its overall score is slightly below the regional and world averages . 
The Vietnamese economy has gradually been climbing the ranks of the mostly unfree since 2011 .  Strong gross domestic product  ( GDP )  growth over the past five years has mirrored this improvement ,  driven by export-focused manufacturing and processing sectors . 
Economic freedom will be enhanced in Vietnam if the Government can successfully expand economic liberalization by promoting international trade and restructuring State-owned enterprises . 
Microsoft investigated Bill Gates' affair before he quit
Microsoft was investigating its co-founder Bill Gates over a 20-year-old affair shortly before he stepped down from the company's board last year . 
The tech giant confirmed that it had launched a probe after concerns were reported about his behavior . 
The firm said it held an investigation with a law firm and provided support to the employee who made the complaint . 
A spokesperson for Mr .  Gates denied that his decision to step back had anything to do with the investigation . 
News of the investigation emerged after Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce after 27 years of marriage . 
On Monday ,  a spokesman for Microsoft said the software company had received a complaint in late 2019 that Mr .  Gates had  " initiate an intimate relationship "  with a female employee in 2000 . 
The investigation did not reach a conclusion ,  as Mr .  Gates stepped down from the board before it was completed . 
Bill and Melinda Gates agreed 'separation contract' before announcing divorce . 
In a LinkedIn post in March of last year ,  Mr .  Gates said that he took the decision so he could spend more time on his charity work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . 
At the time ,  he wrote :   " With respect to Microsoft ,  stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company .  Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work .  .  .  I feel more optimistic than ever about the progress the company is making and how it can continue to benefit the world .  " 
However ,  the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Microsoft's board had decided that Mr .  Gates's involvement with a female employee was inappropriate and he needed to step down . 
However ,  Gates’ spokeswoman  " Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter .  In fact ,  he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier .  " 
Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce earlier this month .  The couple have spent billions on charitable causes around the world and have pledged to continue to work together at the foundation once their divorce is finalized . 
US media reported that the two had agreed on how to divide their property and assets before announcing their separation . 
Mr .  Gates ,  65 ,  is the fourth wealthiest person in the world ,  according to Forbes ,  and is worth $124bn  ( £89bn )  . 
He co-founded Microsoft - now the world's biggest software company - in the 1970s and remained full-time at the firm until 2008 . 
The couple's estate is believed to include multi-million dollar properties in the states of Washington ,  Florida ,  and Wyoming .  Their main residence is a lakeside mansion in Medina ,  Washington that is reported to be worth at least $127m . 
Samsung to shift major portion of monitor production from China to HCMC
Samsung Vina Electronics announced on June 19 that a major portion of Samsung’s monitor production would be shifted from China to the Samsung HCMC CE Complex at the Saigon Hi-tech Park in District 9 ,  HCMC ,  this year . 
The South Korean tech giant is developing a production chain for over 40 monitor models at its factory in HCMC .  Once the shift is complete ,  Vietnam will become one of the largest suppliers of Samsung monitors in the world ,  according to Tuoi Tre newspaper . 
A Samsung representative said the shift will help Vietnamese consumers become the first to use the company’s latest monitors ,  while the country will also help Samsung monitors increase their market presence in Southeast Asia . 
Data from global market intelligence firm IDC indicated that Samsung is the leading producer of monitors in Vietnam ,  with Samsung monitors of 24 inches or larger accounting for 34% of the Vietnamese market in the first quarter of 2020 . 
US Vice President is set to visit Vietnam and Singapore this month
Kamala Harris will become the first US vice president to visit Vietnam in August during her trip that will also include Singapore . 
Her trip to the two Southeast Asian countries this month is to reinforce global partnerships .  The US vice president will engage the leaders of both Vietnam and Singapore on issues of mutual interest ,  including regional security ,  the global response to the coronavirus epidemic ,  and climate change ,  Harris' communications director Symone Sanders said . 
Vietnam has received five million COVID-19 vaccine doses from the United States in a bid to fighting the global pandemic while 75 % of Singapore's population has been inoculated at least one dose . 
A good portion of Harris’ trip will likely concentrate on the importance of US partnerships in the region as the Biden administration’s focus on its ties in Asia . 
President Biden has repeatedly spoken about the need to counter China's expanding influence in the Asia-Pacific region and boost democracy in the Indo-Pacific region .  This week ,  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is on an Asia swing of his own ,  newswire The Hill reported ,  meeting with leaders in Vietnam and the Philippines . 
Harvest season of Vanh Khuyen persimmons in northern highlands
The Vanh Khuyen persimmons are native to the district bordering China .  Cultivated on steep hills and mountains in Vietnam’s northern highlands ,  the persimmon trees need careful in combination with regular weeding . 
Local farmers usually use a long bamboo stick with a cloth bag at one end to harvest the persimmons . 
The persimmons are harvested at 5 a . m .  in order to keep the overnight freshness of the fruits .    Most of these persmisson trees are grown from root-cuttings ,  not from seeds or branches .  Strong trees’ fruits can be harvested after three years ,  with output reaching their maximum in the fifth year . 
According to local farmers ,  the distinguishing feature of Vanh Khuyen persimmons is a full blossom-like sepal with round fruits ,  no seeds ,  and a crunchy ,  sweet taste .  As the fruits are ripe ,  the sepal would appear more defined . 
Harvesting takes a lot of time ,  so usually gather the fruits by some tree stumps to take a break before taking them down to sell . 
Good persimmons have gleaming skins with a chartreuse shade ,  a crispy texture ,  and a gentle sweet taste ,  a farmer said
I love you
The science behind a climate headline
In 4 minutes  ,  atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change  ,  with her team -- one of thousands who contributed -- taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule  . 
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change  ,  and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog  . 
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science  . 
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  ,  or IPCC  ,  put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system  . 
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic  . 
And every one of those scientists is in a research group  ,  and every research group studies a wide variety of topics  . 
And in each one of these research areas  ,  of which there are even more  ,  there are PhD students  ,  like me  ,  and we study incredibly narrow topics  ,  things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules  . 
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene  . 
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain  . 
But still  ,  we look at the pieces  . 
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each  ,  on minute timescales  . 
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia  .  There are others  . 
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest  ,  from above  . 
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us  . 
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today  . 
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements  . 
We have to get special flight clearance  . 
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule  ,  they write one scientific paper on the subject  . 
And as a body of knowledge builds up  ,  it will form one subsection  ,  or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC  ,  although we have others  . 
So you can imagine the scale of the effort  . 
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers  ,  in order to make headlines like these  . 
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm  . 
Well  ,  coming out of the research labs just now  ,  for our generation  ,  is the possibility to do that  . 
You had to take a spaceship  ,  shrink it down  ,  inject it into the bloodstream  . 
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries  . 
He can look at these 65 , 000 points of activation per second  .

Last Thursday ,  Finland's PM Sanna Marin spoke she was upset about her dancing videos in a private space a few weeks ago going viral on social networks while they were only shared among her friends . 
Her speech came after her two-minute video of singing and dancing with some well-known influencers and artists on social media as well as in national media a day before . 
The clips were known to have been originally uploaded to a private Instagram account .  The 36-year-old PM is the world's youngest senior leader after being elected to the chair of Finland’s PM in December 2019 .  Marin said she knew she was being filmed by that time but never thought the private videos would appear publicly . 
Meanwhile ,  there are many Finns who have voiced support for Marin for combining her private life with her own high-profile career .

The scenes are believed to have been publicly filmed about 12 months before Finland’s next general election took place .  It has been unknown who leaked the videos . 
Early this year ,  Marin told she and other senior female leaders have been also attacked with extensive hate words for their gender as well as appearance while in office .

Indonesia :  A ban on cough syrup material linked to a West African country's child deaths
Last weekend ,  the Indonesian authorities launched a ban on ingredients linked to cough syrups that were believed to cause the deaths of 70 children in the West African country of Gambia .  The move came after the launch of a governmental investigation over acute kidney damage that was blamed for more than 20 children deaths in the capital Jakarta this year . 
Meanwhile ,  according to an announcement by Food and drug regulator BPOM ,  the possibility that the ingredients ,  diethylene glycol ,  and ethylene glycol have been reviewed in an investigation into how they had contaminated other materials that are used as solvents . 
Besides ,  the Gambian and Indian governments have also launched investigations over the deaths from the local cases of acute kidney injury that were said to be linked to cough syrups made by Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd ,  headquartered in New Delhi ,  India . 
In a study by The World Health Organization ,   " unacceptable "  levels of the ingredients were found in four Maiden products which can be toxic . 
To protect the health ,  at the time of registration ,  BPOM required that diethylene glycol  ( DEG )  and ethylene glycol  ( EG )  are not allowed to be present in all medicinal syrup products for children and adults ,  in a statement by the regulator . 
Accordingly ,  the four products linked to the mentioned deaths are not registered in Indonesia ,  the regulator reiterated ,  nor are any other Maiden products . 
Black diamond ,  the largest ever cut ,  sells for £3 . 2 million
Yesterday ,  a rare black diamond at 555 carats named “The Enigma "  went under the hammer in Britain’s London for £3 . 16 million  ( $4 . 3 million ,  3 . 8 million euros )  .  The world's largest known cut diamond has recently gone on display for the first time . 
It is known that the 55-faced diamond ,  or carbonado ,  had been created by a meteorite or an asteroid that hit the Earth around 2 . 6 billion years ago . 
The 555 . 55-carat diamond worth £3 . 16 million excluded the buyer's premium at an online auction of London's renowned Sotheby's auction house that also accepted crypto-currency bids . 
Carbonados are said to have extraterrestrial origins because they are usually found close to the surface of the Earth . 
The specific type of black diamond was formed from meteoric impacts that produce natural chemical vapor deposition .  Carbonado ,  one of the most difficult substances to cut ,  is also thought to be created from supernovae explosions ,  the root of diamond-bearing asteroids which collided with the Earth ultimately ,  according to the auction house . 
Previously ,  the 55-faced diamond had never been displayed by its unnamed owner over the past 20 years . 
It took three years to turn the Carbonado into a 55-face jewel which recently went on show in some venues ,  including Dubai ,  Los Angeles ,  and London ,  said experts . 
The shape of “The Enigma "  was inspired by the Hamsa ,  the Middle East palm-shaped symbol of power and protection while its faces are also related to the number five . 
It is the size ,  shape ,  and source of the black diamond that makes it groundbreaking and amazing ,  according to Tobias Kormind ,  managing director of Europe's largest online jeweler ,  Mayfair . 
He also added that diamonds are commonly cut into one of 10 popular shapes but the Carbonado's form resembles a hand . 
Despite not being a gem-quality diamond or not being normally used in jewelry or sold at auction ,  “The Enigma” ,  which Sotheby's called a  " cosmic wonder "  ,   has recently grown in popularity . 
Carbonados are commonly used in industrial drilling because of their extraordinary hardness . 
In 2021 ,  the Key 10138 diamond of Hong Kong worth 12 . 3 million dollars was also paid in crypto-currency .

Vietnam’s economic freedom score is 58 . 8 ,  making its economy the 105th freest among 180 countries and territories in the 2020 Index of Economic Freedom by the U . S . -based Heritage Foundation .

The Southeast Asian nation is ranked 21st among 42 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ,  and its overall score is slightly below the regional and world averages . 
The Vietnamese economy has gradually been climbing the ranks of the mostly unfree since 2011 .  Strong gross domestic product  ( GDP )  growth over the past five years has mirrored this improvement ,  driven by export-focused manufacturing and processing sectors . 
Economic freedom will be enhanced in Vietnam if the Government can successfully expand economic liberalization by promoting international trade and restructuring State-owned enterprises .
